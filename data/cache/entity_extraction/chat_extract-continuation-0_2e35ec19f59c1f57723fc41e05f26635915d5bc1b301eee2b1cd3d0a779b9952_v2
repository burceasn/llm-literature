After its beneficial results in various fields such as monitoring, surveillance, remote diagnosis and information provision of COVID-19, chatbots have started to be used more frequently for health purposes after the pandemic period. ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022, and garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. Trials and applications regarding the use of ChatGPT in many different areas became a trending topic in the first quarter of 2023, and the studies intensified on March 14, 2023, when ChatGPT-4 was released. The purpose of this study is to review studies which evaluate ChatGPT usage for health, healthcare management and policy fields. Although the use of AI and chatbots is not a novel subject in healthcare, ChatGPT’s reliability, wide coverage, multi-linguality and being largely free of charge made it outstanding. While there are many concerns about patient safety, data privacy and confidentiality, ChatGPT has been seen to contribute in many areas, such as health management, policy, public health, and health promotion. Studies conducted for the third version demonstrated that ChatGPT has been used for various mechanisms as decision support systems, administrative tools and public health agents. Research findings in a short period of time during the first phase of ChatGPT usage show that the newly established chatbot would also help increasing digital health literacy by its robustness and accuracy. ChatGPT also has promising potential for psychiatric and psychological support which other chatbots focus. ChatGPT is also anticipated to contribute to health management and policy research in the field of health management and policy research, which needs data analysis and forecasting from the clinical and hospital to the national and international levels. © (2023), (Refik Saydam National Public Health Agency (RSNPHA)).
