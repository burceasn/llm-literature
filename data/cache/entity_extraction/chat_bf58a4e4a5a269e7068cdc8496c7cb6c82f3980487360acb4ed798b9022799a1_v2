Recently natural language processing and generative pre-training transformer (GPT) models have gained particular interest due to their ability to simulate human conversation. We aimed to explore output of the ChatGPT model (OpenAI, https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) regarding current debates in cardiovascular CT. Prompts included debate questions from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography 2023 programme as well as questions about high risk plaque (HRP), quantitative plaque analysis, and how AI will transform cardiovascular CT. The AI model rapidly provided plausible responses including both pro and con sides of the argument. Advantages of AI for cardiovascular CT that were described by the AI model included improving image quality, speed of reporting, accuracy, and consistency. The AI model also acknowledged the importance for continued involvement of clinicians in patient care. © 2023 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
