Hence, we performed a scoping review of available literature to understand the current state of LLM use in medicine and to provide a guideline for future utilization in academia. Materials and methods: A scoping review of the literature was performed through a Medline search on February 16, 2023 using a combination of keywords including artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, generative pre-trained transformer, ChatGPT, and large language model. There were no restrictions to language or date of publication. Records not pertaining to LLMs were excluded. Records pertaining to LLM ChatBots and ChatGPT were identified and evaluated separately. Among the records pertaining to LLM ChatBots and ChatGPT, those that suggest recommendations for ChatGPT use in academia were utilized to create guideline statements for ChatGPT and LLM use in academic medicine. Results: A total of 87 records were identified. 30 records were not pertaining to large language models and were excluded. 54 records underwent a full-text review for evaluation. There were 33 records related to LLM ChatBots or ChatGPT. Discussion: From assessing these texts, five guideline statements for LLM use was developed: (1) ChatGPT/LLM cannot be cited as an author in scientific manuscripts; (2) If use of ChatGPT/LLM are considered for use in academic work, author(s) should have at least a basic understanding of what ChatGPT/LLM is; (3) Do not use ChatGPT/LLM to produce entirety of text in manuscripts; humans must be held accountable for use of ChatGPT/LLM and contents created by ChatGPT/LLM should be meticulously verified by humans; (4) ChatGPT/LLMs may be used for editing and refining of text; (5) Any use of ChatGPT/LLM should be transparent and should be clearly outlined in scientific manuscripts and acknowledged. Conclusion: Future authors should remain mindful of the potential impact their academic work may have on healthcare and continue to uphold the highest ethical standards and integrity when utilizing ChatGPT/LLM. © 2023 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a large language model used in academic medicine for tasks such as editing and refining text, but it cannot be cited as an author in scientific manuscripts.
