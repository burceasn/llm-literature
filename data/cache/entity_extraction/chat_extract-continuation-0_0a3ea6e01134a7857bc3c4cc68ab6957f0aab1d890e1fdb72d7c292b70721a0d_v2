Patients frequently share feedback about medications they have taken to express their experiences and raise public awareness. The application of sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in the healthcare sector, as it allows for examining these public reviews to assess the efficacy and popularity of various medications. This research presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis of customer reviews from DrugRev, a dataset of drug reviews. The study evaluates customer sentiment regarding drug effectiveness, side effects, and ease of use. We employ natural language processing using multiple machine learning and deep learning algorithms to obtain valuable insights into customer satisfaction and preferences, aiding consumers and healthcare professionals in making informed medication choices. The findings demonstrate that Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit and BERT outperformed all other models with an F1 Score of 92.17. The outcomes of our experiments illustrate that our system can deliver precise, effective, and scalable drug suggestions. By understanding customer sentiments, we contribute to improving healthcare decision-making and enhancing the quality of healthcare services.  © 2023 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DRUGREV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DrugRev is a dataset of drug reviews used for sentiment analysis in the healthcare sector to evaluate customer sentiment regarding drug effectiveness, side effects, and ease of use)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL GATED RECURRENT UNIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A machine learning model used in the study to analyze customer reviews, achieving an F1 Score of 92.17)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A deep learning model used in the study to analyze customer reviews, achieving an F1 Score of 92.17)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization that published the research in 2023)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>A process applied to customer reviews to assess the efficacy and popularity of medications, using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DRUGREV<|>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS<|>DrugRev is the dataset used for sentiment analysis in the study<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL GATED RECURRENT UNIT<|>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS<|>The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit is a model used in the sentiment analysis process<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS<|>BERT is a model used in the sentiment analysis process<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IEEE<|>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS<|>IEEE published the research on sentiment analysis<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL GATED RECURRENT UNIT<|>BERT<|>Both models were used in the study and outperformed other models with an F1 Score of 92.17<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
