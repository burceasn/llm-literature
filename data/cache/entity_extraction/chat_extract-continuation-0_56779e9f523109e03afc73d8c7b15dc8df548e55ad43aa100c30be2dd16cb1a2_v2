The condition has repercussions beyond the realm of public health. Twitter is one platform where people post reactions to events during the outbreak. User-generated information, like tweets, presents unique challenges for sentiment analysis on Twitter data. With that in mind, this work employs four methods for analyzing Twitter data in terms of sentiment: the vector space model (TF-IDF) with three different ensemble machine learning models (voting, bagging, and stacking) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Experiments showed that BERT outperformed the other three techniques, with an F1-score of 74%, a precision of 74%, and a recall of 74% for categorizing five sentiment classes on data from a Kaggle competition (Coronavirus tweets NLP-Text Classification).
