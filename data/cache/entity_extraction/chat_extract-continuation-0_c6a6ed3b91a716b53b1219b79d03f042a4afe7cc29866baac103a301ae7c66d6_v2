The history of AI dates to the mid-20th century, when researchers began to explore the possibility of creating machines that could perform tasks that were typically reserved for human beings. The first major accomplishment was in 1943, when the American neurophysiologist and cybernetician Warren Sturgis McCulloch from the College of Medicine, at the University of Illinois, IL, USA, and the neurophysiologist Walter Harry Pitts, Jr. from the University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA, published a paper titled “A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity,” in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics (volume 5, pages 115-133) which proposed a model of neural networks that could perform logical operations. This was an important early contribution to the field of artificial neural networks that could be used to simulate human thought processes, this model is called MCP neuron. But it is probably Alan Mathison Turing who published in 1950 “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” in which he proposed the “Turing test” in 1936 which is a mathematical model of computation describing an abstract machine. This development was the most important milestone in the history of artificial intelligence. The term “artificial intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon at a conference in Dartmouth College in 1956. In the early years, AI research was heavily focused on developing rule-based systems and symbolic reasoning. However, as the limitations of these approaches became clear, and in the 1980s, researchers began to shift their focus toward machine learning and neural networks. One of the most significant developments in AI was the creation of expert systems, which were designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts in specific fields. These systems were widely used in industries such as finance, medicine, and engineering. In the 1990s and 2000s, the focus shifted toward developing more sophisticated machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and deep neural networks. This led to breakthroughs in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, and AI applications began to be used in areas such as self-driving cars, recommender systems, and intelligent personal assistants. More recently, the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms has allowed for the creation of more advanced AI systems, including autonomous agents and robots. These systems are capable of learning and adapting to new environments and are being developed for use in fields such as healthcare, agriculture, and manufacturing. This chapter will talk about the origin and evolution of AI, how its impact has affected social development, and what can we expect of a science that evolves so fast and that with the arrival of Web 3.0 is going to be even more present in our daily life. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Raquel V.
