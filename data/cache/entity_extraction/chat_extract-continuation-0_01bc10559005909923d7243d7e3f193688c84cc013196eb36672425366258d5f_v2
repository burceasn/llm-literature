While several closed-source summarization tools based on large language models (LLMs) now exist, rigorous and systematic evaluations of their outputs are lacking. Furthermore, there is a paucity of high-quality datasets and appropriate benchmark tasks with which to evaluate these tools. We address these issues with four contributions: we release Clinfo.ai, an open-source WebApp that answers clinical questions based on dynamically retrieved scientific literature; we specify an information retrieval and abstractive summarization task to evaluate the performance of such retrieval-augmented LLM systems; we release a dataset of 200 questions and corresponding answers derived from published systematic reviews, which we name PubMed Retrieval and Synthesis (PubMedRS-200); and report benchmark results for Clinfo.ai and other publicly available OpenQA systems on PubMedRS-200.  © 2023 The Authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CLINFO.AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Clinfo.ai is an open-source WebApp designed to answer clinical questions based on dynamically retrieved scientific literature)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBMED RETRIEVAL AND SYNTHESIS (PUBMEDRS-200)<|>EVENT<|>PubMedRS-200 is a dataset of 200 questions and corresponding answers derived from published systematic reviews, used to evaluate retrieval-augmented LLM systems)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE AUTHORS<|>PERSON<|>The Authors are the creators of the Clinfo.ai WebApp and the PubMedRS-200 dataset, as well as the contributors to the benchmark results reported in the text)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINFO.AI<|>PUBMED RETRIEVAL AND SYNTHESIS (PUBMEDRS-200)<|>Clinfo.ai was evaluated using the PubMedRS-200 dataset to benchmark its performance<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHORS<|>CLINFO.AI<|>The Authors developed and released Clinfo.ai as an open-source WebApp<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHORS<|>PUBMED RETRIEVAL AND SYNTHESIS (PUBMEDRS-200)<|>The Authors created and released the PubMedRS-200 dataset<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
