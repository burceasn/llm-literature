Among these, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has focused on contextualizing word embeddings to extract context and semantics of the words. On the other hand, post-transcriptional 2'-O-methylation (Nm) RNA modification is important in various cellular tasks and related to a number of diseases. The existing high-throughput experimental techniques take longer time to detect these modifications, and costly in exploring these functional processes. Here, to deeply understand the associated biological processes faster,wecome up with an efficient method BERT2OME to infer 2'-O-methylation RNA modification sites from RNA sequences. BERT2OME combines BERT-based model with convolutional neural networks (CNN) to infer the relationship between the modification sites and RNA sequence content. Unlike the methods proposed so far, BERT2OME assumes each given RNA sequence as a text and focuses on improving the modification prediction performance by integrating the pretrained deep learningbased language model BERT. Additionally, our transformer-based approach could infer modification sites across multiple species. According to 5-fold cross-validation, human and mouse accuracies were 99.15% and 94.35% respectively. Similarly, ROC AUC scores were 0.99, 0.94 for the same species. Detailed results show that BERT2OME reduces the time consumed in biological experiments and outperforms the existing approaches across different datasets and species over multiple metrics. Additionally, deep learning approaches such as 2D CNNs are more promising in learning BERT attributes than more conventional machine learning methods.  © 2023 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a language model focused on contextualizing word embeddings to extract context and semantics of words)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT2OME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT2OME is a method combining BERT-based models with convolutional neural networks (CNN) to infer 2'-O-methylation RNA modification sites from RNA sequences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are deep learning models used in BERT2OME to infer relationships between RNA modification sites and sequence content)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IEEE is the organization that published the research on BERT2OME and related methods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN<|>GEO<|>Human refers to the species for which BERT2OME achieved 99.15% accuracy in predicting RNA modifications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOUSE<|>GEO<|>Mouse refers to the species for which BERT2OME achieved 94.35% accuracy in predicting RNA modifications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2'-O-METHYLATION (NM) RNA MODIFICATION<|>EVENT<|>2'-O-methylation (Nm) RNA modification is a biological process related to various cellular tasks and diseases, which BERT2OME aims to predict)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>BERT2OME<|>BERT2OME integrates the pretrained deep learning-based language model BERT to improve RNA modification prediction performance<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT2OME<|>CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN)<|>BERT2OME combines BERT with convolutional neural networks (CNN) to infer RNA modification sites<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT2OME<|>HUMAN<|>BERT2OME achieved 99.15% accuracy in predicting RNA modifications for humans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT2OME<|>MOUSE<|>BERT2OME achieved 94.35% accuracy in predicting RNA modifications for mice<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT2OME<|>2'-O-METHYLATION (NM) RNA MODIFICATION<|>BERT2OME is designed to predict 2'-O-methylation (Nm) RNA modification sites<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IEEE<|>BERT2OME<|>IEEE published the research on BERT2OME and its applications<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
