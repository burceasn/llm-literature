However, previous studies focused on extracting only a limited set of medical concepts to support information extraction in the cancer domain for the Spanish language. Building on the success of deep learning for processing natural language texts, this paper proposes a transformer-based approach to extract named entities from breast cancer clinical notes written in Spanish and compares several language models. To facilitate this approach, a schema for annotating clinical notes with breast cancer concepts is presented, and a corpus for breast cancer is developed. Results indicate that both BERT-based and RoBERTa-based language models demonstrate competitive performance in clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER). Specifically, BETO and multilingual BERT achieve F-scores of 93.71% and 94.63%, respectively. Additionally, RoBERTa Biomedical attains an F-score of 95.01%, while RoBERTa BNE achieves an F-score of 94.54%. The findings suggest that transformers can feasibly extract information in the clinical domain in the Spanish language, with the use of models trained on biomedical texts contributing to enhanced results. The proposed approach takes advantage of transfer learning techniques by fine-tuning language models to automatically represent text features and avoiding the time-consuming feature engineering process. © 2023 The Author(s)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are widely adopted systems that support clinical research by providing a source of medical data)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a transformer-based language model used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in clinical texts, achieving competitive performance)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RoBERTa is a transformer-based language model, including specialized versions like RoBERTa Biomedical and RoBERTa BNE, used for clinical NER tasks)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BETO is a BERT-based language model specifically adapted for the Spanish language, achieving high performance in clinical NER tasks)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTILINGUAL BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Multilingual BERT is a version of BERT designed to handle multiple languages, including Spanish, and is used for clinical NER tasks)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERTA BIOMEDICAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RoBERTa Biomedical is a specialized version of RoBERTa trained on biomedical texts, achieving high performance in clinical NER tasks)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERTA BNE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RoBERTa BNE is a version of RoBERTa adapted for the Spanish language, achieving competitive performance in clinical NER tasks)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER)<|>EVENT<|>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a process used to extract named entities from clinical notes, particularly in the breast cancer domain for Spanish texts)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAST CANCER CLINICAL NOTES<|>EVENT<|>Breast cancer clinical notes are medical records written in Spanish, used as a dataset for evaluating transformer-based language models in clinical NER tasks)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS)<|>NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER)<|>EHRs provide the data source for clinical NER tasks, enabling the extraction of medical concepts<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER)<|>BERT is used as a language model for clinical NER tasks, achieving competitive performance<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERTA<|>NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER)<|>RoBERTa is used as a language model for clinical NER tasks, achieving competitive performance<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETO<|>NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER)<|>BETO is a BERT-based model adapted for Spanish, achieving high performance in clinical NER tasks<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTILINGUAL BERT<|>NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER)<|>Multilingual BERT is used for clinical NER tasks in Spanish, achieving competitive performance<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERTA BIOMEDICAL<|>NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER)<|>RoBERTa Biomedical is a specialized model for biomedical texts, achieving high performance in clinical NER tasks<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERTA BNE<|>NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER)<|>RoBERTa BNE is adapted for Spanish, achieving competitive performance in clinical NER tasks<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BREAST CANCER CLINICAL NOTES<|>NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER)<|>Breast cancer clinical notes are the dataset used for evaluating transformer-based models in clinical NER tasks<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
