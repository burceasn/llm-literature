Early research into the potential application of ChatGPT in healthcare has focused mainly on clinical and administrative functions. The diagnostic ability and utility of ChatGPT in histopathology is not well defined. We benchmarked the performance of ChatGPT against pathologists in diagnostic histopathology, and evaluated the collaborative potential between pathologists and ChatGPT to deliver more accurate diagnoses. Methods and results: In Part 1 of the study, pathologists and ChatGPT were subjected to a series of questions encompassing common diagnostic conundrums in histopathology. For Part 2, pathologists reviewed a series of challenging virtual slides and provided their diagnoses before and after consultation with ChatGPT. We found that ChatGPT performed worse than pathologists in reaching the correct diagnosis. Consultation with ChatGPT provided limited help and information generated from ChatGPT is dependent on the prompts provided by the pathologists and is not always correct. Finally, we surveyed pathologists who rated the diagnostic accuracy of ChatGPT poorly, but found it useful as an advanced search engine. Conclusions: The use of ChatGPT4 as a diagnostic tool in histopathology is limited by its inherent shortcomings. Judicious evaluation of the information and histopathology diagnosis generated from ChatGPT4 is essential and cannot replace the acuity and judgement of a pathologist. However, future advances in generative AI may expand its role in the field of histopathology. © 2023 The Authors.
