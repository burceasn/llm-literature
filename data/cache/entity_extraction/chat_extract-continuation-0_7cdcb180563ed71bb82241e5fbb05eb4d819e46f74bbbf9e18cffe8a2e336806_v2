In recent years, deep learning techniques have been shown to be effective in classifying radiology reports. This article investigates the use of deep learning techniques with attention mechanisms to achieve better performance in the classification of radiology reports. We focus on various Natural Language Processing approaches, such as LSTM with Attention, BERT, and GPT-4, evaluated on a chest tomography report dataset regarding neoplastic diseases collected from an Italian hospital. In particular, we compare the results with a previous machine learning system, showing that models based on attention mechanisms can achieve higher performance. The Attention Mechanism allows us to identify the most relevant bits of text used by the model to make its predictions. We show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the hierarchical classification of radiology reports. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of GPT-4 on the classification of these reports in a zero-shot setup through prompt engineering, showing interesting results even with a small context and a non-English language. Our findings suggest that deep learning techniques with attention mechanisms may be successful in the classification of radiology reports even in non-English languages for which it is not possible to leverage on large text corpus. © 2013 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RADIOLOGY REPORTS<|>EVENT<|>Radiology reports are textual information used to improve clinical care and support research, often classified using deep learning techniques)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>EVENT<|>Deep learning techniques, including attention mechanisms, are used to classify radiology reports and achieve state-of-the-art results)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATTENTION MECHANISM<|>EVENT<|>A technique used in deep learning models to identify the most relevant bits of text for making predictions)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LSTM WITH ATTENTION<|>EVENT<|>A Natural Language Processing approach used to classify radiology reports)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>EVENT<|>A Natural Language Processing model evaluated for classifying radiology reports)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT-4<|>EVENT<|>A Natural Language Processing model evaluated in a zero-shot setup for classifying radiology reports)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEST TOMOGRAPHY REPORT DATASET<|>EVENT<|>A dataset regarding neoplastic diseases collected from an Italian hospital, used for evaluating deep learning models)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALIAN HOSPITAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization that provided the chest tomography report dataset used in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization that published the article in 2013)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RADIOLOGY REPORTS<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>Deep learning techniques are used to classify radiology reports<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>ATTENTION MECHANISM<|>Attention mechanisms are a key component of deep learning models for text classification<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LSTM WITH ATTENTION<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>LSTM with Attention is a deep learning technique used for classifying radiology reports<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>BERT is a deep learning model evaluated for classifying radiology reports<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-4<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>GPT-4 is a deep learning model evaluated in a zero-shot setup for classifying radiology reports<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHEST TOMOGRAPHY REPORT DATASET<|>ITALIAN HOSPITAL<|>The chest tomography report dataset was collected from an Italian hospital<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHEST TOMOGRAPHY REPORT DATASET<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>The dataset is used to evaluate deep learning models for classifying radiology reports<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IEEE<|>RADIOLOGY REPORTS<|>IEEE published the article discussing the classification of radiology reports<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
