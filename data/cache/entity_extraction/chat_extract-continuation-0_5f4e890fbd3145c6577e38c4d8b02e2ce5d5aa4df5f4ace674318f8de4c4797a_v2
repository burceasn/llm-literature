In the healthcare domain, medical experts create clinical text to overcome the limitation of well-defined and schema driven information systems. The objective of this research work is to create a framework, which can convert clinical text into causal knowledge. Methods: A practical approach based on term expansion, phrase generation, BERT based phrase embedding and semantic matching, semantic enrichment, expert verification, and model evolution has been used to construct a comprehensive causality mining framework. This active transfer learning based framework along with its supplementary services, is able to extract and enrich, causal relationships and their corresponding entities from clinical text. Results: The multi-model transfer learning technique when applied over multiple iterations, gains substantial performance improvements. We also present a comparative analysis of the presented techniques with their common alternatives, which demonstrate the correctness of our approach and its ability to capture most causal relationships. Conclusion: The presented framework has provided cutting-edge results in the healthcare domain. However, the framework can be tweaked to provide causality detection in other domains, as well. Significance: The presented framework is generic enough to be utilized in any domain, healthcare services can gain massive benefits due to the voluminous and various nature of its data. This causal knowledge extraction framework can be used to summarize clinical text, create personas, discover medical knowledge, and provide evidence to clinical decision making. © 2021\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CAUSALITY MINING FRAMEWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A framework designed to convert clinical text into causal knowledge using advanced natural language processing techniques, including term expansion, phrase generation, BERT-based phrase embedding, semantic matching, and expert verification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCARE DOMAIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The domain where the causality mining framework is applied to extract causal relationships from clinical text, aiding in summarizing clinical text, creating personas, discovering medical knowledge, and supporting clinical decision-making)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTI-MODEL TRANSFER LEARNING TECHNIQUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A technique used within the causality mining framework to improve performance over multiple iterations, enabling the extraction and enrichment of causal relationships from clinical text)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAUSALITY MINING FRAMEWORK<|>HEALTHCARE DOMAIN<|>The causality mining framework is applied in the healthcare domain to extract causal knowledge from clinical text<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAUSALITY MINING FRAMEWORK<|>MULTI-MODEL TRANSFER LEARNING TECHNIQUE<|>The causality mining framework utilizes the multi-model transfer learning technique to improve its performance in extracting causal relationships<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
