It plays an important role in understanding gene expression and transcription, biological research, and drug development. In recent years, language representation models have had remarkable results in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have received extensive attention from researchers. Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers (BERT) has been shown to have state-of-the-art results in other domains, using the concept of word embedding to capture the semantics of sentences. In the case of small datasets, previous models often cannot capture the upstream and downstream global information of DNA sequences well, so it is reasonable to refer the BERT model to the training of DNA sequences. Models pre-trained with large datasets and then fine-tuned with specific datasets have excellent results on different downstream tasks. In this study, firstly, we regard DNA sequences as sentences and tokenize them using K-mer method, and later utilize BERT to matrix the fixed length of the tokenized sentences, perform feature extraction, and later perform classification operations. We compare this method with current state-of-the-art models, and the DNABERT method has better performance with average improvement 0.013537, 0.010866, 0.029813, 0.052611, 0.122131 in ACC, F1-score, MCC, Precision, Recall, respectively. Overall, one of the advantages of BERT is that the pre-training strategy speeds up the convergence in the network in migration learning and improves the learning ability of the network. DNABER model has advantageous generalization ability on other DNA datasets and can be utilized on other sequence classification tasks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROTEIN-DNA BINDING SITES<|>EVENT<|>The study of Protein-DNA binding sites is a fundamental problem in genome biology research, playing a key role in understanding gene expression, transcription, biological research, and drug development)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>EVENT<|>A field where language representation models, such as BERT, have achieved remarkable results and received extensive attention from researchers)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FOR TRANSFORMERS (BERT)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A state-of-the-art model in NLP that uses word embedding to capture sentence semantics and has been adapted for DNA sequence analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNABERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A method that applies BERT to DNA sequences, tokenizing them using the K-mer method and achieving improved performance in sequence classification tasks)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The publisher of the study under an exclusive license in 2022)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROTEIN-DNA BINDING SITES<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>The study of Protein-DNA binding sites benefits from advancements in NLP models like BERT<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FOR TRANSFORMERS (BERT)<|>DNABERT<|>DNABERT is an adaptation of the BERT model for DNA sequence analysis<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNABERT<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>The DNABERT study was published under an exclusive license by Springer Nature Switzerland AG<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
