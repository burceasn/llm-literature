The emergence of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) systems, presents new opportunities to enhance HF management. In this review, we identified and examined existing studies on the use of ChatGPT in HF care by searching multiple medical databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, and Scopus). We assessed the role of ChatGPT in HF prevention, diagnosis, and management, focusing on its influence on clinical decision-making and patient education. However, ChatGPT faces limited training data, inherent biases, and ethical issues that hinder its widespread clinical adoption. We review these limitations and highlight the need for improved training approaches, greater model transparency, and robust regulatory compliance. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of ChatGPT in managing HF, particularly in reducing hospital readmissions and improving patient outcomes with customized treatment plans while addressing social determinants of health (SDoH). In this review, we aim to provide healthcare professionals and policymakers with an in-depth understanding of ChatGPT’s potential and constraints within the realm of HF care. © 2024 by the authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HEART FAILURE (HF)<|>EVENT<|>Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality, morbidity, and financial burden worldwide, requiring advanced management strategies)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is an advanced AI technology, specifically a Generative Pre-trained Transformer system, used in HF care for prevention, diagnosis, and management)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBMED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PubMed is a medical database used to search for studies on the use of ChatGPT in HF care)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE SCHOLAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Scholar is a medical database used to search for studies on the use of ChatGPT in HF care)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDLINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Medline is a medical database used to search for studies on the use of ChatGPT in HF care)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scopus is a medical database used to search for studies on the use of ChatGPT in HF care)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>HEART FAILURE (HF)<|>ChatGPT is used to enhance the management of heart failure, including prevention, diagnosis, and clinical decision-making<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>PUBMED<|>Studies on ChatGPT's role in HF care were searched in PubMed<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>GOOGLE SCHOLAR<|>Studies on ChatGPT's role in HF care were searched in Google Scholar<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>MEDLINE<|>Studies on ChatGPT's role in HF care were searched in Medline<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>SCOPUS<|>Studies on ChatGPT's role in HF care were searched in Scopus<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
