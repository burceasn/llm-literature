However, developing an effective way to detect such news is challenging, especially when published news involves mixing true and false information. Detecting COVID-19 fake news has become a critical task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). This paper explores the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms and fine-tuning pre-trained transformer-based models, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and COVID-Twitter-BERT (CT-BERT), for COVID-19 fake news detection. We evaluate the performance of different downstream neural network structures, such as CNN and BiGRU layers, added on top of BERT and CT-BERT with frozen or unfrozen parameters. Our experiments on a real-world COVID-19 fake news dataset demonstrate that incorporating BiGRU on top of the CT-BERT model achieves outstanding performance, with a state-of-the-art F1 score of 98%. These results have significant implications for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 misinformation and highlight the potential of advanced machine learning models for fake news detection.
