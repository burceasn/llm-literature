Population-based interventions to increase physical activity are needed. Existing automated expert systems (e.g., computer-tailored interventions) have significant limitations that result in low long-term effectiveness. Therefore, innovative approaches are needed. This special communication aims to describe and discuss a novel mHealth intervention approach that proactively offers participants with hyper-personalised intervention content adjusted in real-time. Methods: Using machine learning approaches, we propose a novel physical activity intervention approach that can learn and adapt in real-time to achieve high levels of personalisation and user engagement, underpinned by a likeable digital assistant. It will consist of three major components: (1) conversations: to increase user's knowledge on a wide range of activity-related topics underpinned by Natural Language Processing; (2) nudge engine: to provide users with hyper-personalised cues to action underpinned by reinforcement learning (i.e., contextual bandit) and integrating real-time data from activity tracking, GPS, GIS, weather, and user provided data; (3) Q&A: to facilitate users asking any physical activity related questions underpinned by generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard) for content generation. Results: The detailed concept of the proposed physical activity intervention platform demonstrates the practical application of a just-in-time adaptive intervention applying various machine learning techniques to deliver a hyper-personalised physical activity intervention in an engaging way. Compared to traditional interventions, the novel platform is expected to show potential for increased user engagement and long-term effectiveness due to: (1) using new variables to personalise content (e.g., GPS, weather), (2) providing behavioural support at the right time in real-time, (3) implementing an engaging digital assistant and (4) improving the relevance of content through applying machine learning algorithms. Conclusion: The use of machine learning is on the rise in every aspect of today's society, however few attempts have been undertaken to harness its potential to achieve health behaviour change. By sharing our intervention concept, we contribute to the ongoing dialogue on creating effective methods for promoting health and well-being in the informatics research community. Future research should focus on refining these techniques and evaluating their effectiveness in controlled and real-world circumstances. © 2023 The Authors\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MHEALTH INTERVENTION<|>EVENT<|>A novel mHealth intervention approach that proactively offers hyper-personalised intervention content adjusted in real-time to increase physical activity and user engagement)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>EVENT<|>A set of techniques used to develop the mHealth intervention, including reinforcement learning, Natural Language Processing, and generative AI for content generation)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>EVENT<|>A technology underpinning the conversations component of the mHealth intervention to increase user knowledge on activity-related topics)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REINFORCEMENT LEARNING<|>EVENT<|>A machine learning approach used in the nudge engine to provide hyper-personalised cues to action)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>A technology used in the Q&A component of the mHealth intervention, including tools like ChatGPT and Bard, to generate content for user questions)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A generative AI tool used in the Q&A component of the mHealth intervention)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A generative AI tool used in the Q&A component of the mHealth intervention)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGITAL ASSISTANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A likeable digital assistant that underpins the mHealth intervention to increase user engagement)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MHEALTH INTERVENTION<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>Machine learning techniques are used to develop and adapt the mHealth intervention in real-time<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MHEALTH INTERVENTION<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>Natural Language Processing underpins the conversations component of the mHealth intervention<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MHEALTH INTERVENTION<|>REINFORCEMENT LEARNING<|>Reinforcement learning is used in the nudge engine to provide hyper-personalised cues to action<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MHEALTH INTERVENTION<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Generative AI is used in the Q&A component to generate content for user questions<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>ChatGPT is a generative AI tool used in the Q&A component of the mHealth intervention<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARD<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Bard is a generative AI tool used in the Q&A component of the mHealth intervention<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIGITAL ASSISTANT<|>MHEALTH INTERVENTION<|>The digital assistant is a key component of the mHealth intervention to increase user engagement<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
