This work explores the development of emotion classification algorithms, focusing on text classification and providing low latency inferencing for seamless application into persistent-state systems. We use a parallel multi-task learning approach, to learn multiple tasks with a single loss function, allowing it to learn representations in both Emotion Classification and Sentiment Analysis simultaneously. We present a detailed analysis of a fine-tuned BERTTiny model EmoBERTTiny for emotion and sentiment classification tasks, comparing its performance against baseline models and state-of-the-art 7B parameter models. EmoBERTTiny is bench-marked against Llama-2-7B-chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct across Accuracy, F1-score, precision-recall curves and inference speed. EmoBERTTiny outperforms pre-trained and state-of-the-art models across all metrics and computational efficiency, achieving 93.14% accuracy in sentiment analysis and 85.48% accuracy on emotion classification. EmoBERTTiny processes a 256 token context window in 8.04ms on average post-tokenization, and 154.23ms on average in total processing speed.
