In clinical research studies, especially comparative effectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially cause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical analyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies to examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured SBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much of the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language processing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from unstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system focusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art transformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH concepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract SBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the difference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured EHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the International Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show that the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH information and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864 patients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more detailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only captured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical narratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of patients' SBDoH factors. ©2021 AMIA - All rights reserved.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SBDoH<|>EVENT<|>Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDoH) are factors that shape people's health and are often documented in clinical narratives but lack structured representation in electronic health records (EHRs).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EHR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are used to store structured patient data, including SBDoH information, but often lack comprehensive details found in clinical narratives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NLP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a technology used to extract SBDoH information from unstructured clinical text, with transformer-based models like BERT and RoBERTa being state-of-the-art.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a transformer-based NLP model used in this study to extract SBDoH concepts from clinical narratives, achieving high F1-scores.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RoBERTa<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RoBERTa is another transformer-based NLP model examined in this study for extracting SBDoH concepts from clinical narratives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AMIA is the organization that holds the rights to the study and its findings, as indicated by the copyright notice.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SBDoH<|>EHR<|>SBDoH information is partially captured in structured EHRs but requires NLP to extract more detailed information from clinical narratives.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NLP<|>BERT<|>BERT is one of the NLP models used in the study to extract SBDoH concepts from clinical narratives.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NLP<|>RoBERTa<|>RoBERTa is another NLP model examined in the study for extracting SBDoH concepts.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>RoBERTa<|>Both BERT and RoBERTa are transformer-based NLP models compared in the study for extracting SBDoH concepts.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SBDoH<|>NLP<|>NLP is used to extract SBDoH information from unstructured clinical narratives, complementing structured EHR data.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SBDoH<|>AMIA<|>The study on SBDoH and NLP is copyrighted by AMIA.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
