Methods: ChatGPT was prompted to generate 20 novel systematic review ideas for 10 different subcategories within the field of craniofa-cial surgery. For each topic, the chatbot was told to give 10 “general” and 10 “specific” ideas that were related to the concept. In order to determine the accuracy of ChatGPT, a literature review was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane. Results: In total, 200 total systematic review research ideas were generated by ChatGPT. We found that the algorithm had an overall 57.5% accuracy at identifying novel systematic review ideas. ChatGPT was found to be 39% accurate for general topics and 76% accurate for specific topics. Conclusion: Craniofacial surgeons should use ChatGPT as a tool. We found that ChatGPT provided more precise answers with specific research questions than with general questions and helped narrow down the search scope, leading to a more relevant and accurate response. Beyond research purposes, ChatGPT can augment patient consultations, improve healthcare equity, and assist in clinical decision-making. With rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), it is important for plastic surgeons to consider using AI in their clinical practice to improve patient-centered outcomes. © 2024 Korean Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is an AI tool used to generate systematic review ideas in the field of craniofacial surgery, with a focus on improving research accuracy and clinical decision-making)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOREAN CLEFT PALATE-CRANIOFACIAL ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Korean Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association is a professional organization involved in craniofacial surgery research and practice)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY<|>EVENT<|>A medical field focused on surgical procedures related to the skull and face, which was the subject of the study using ChatGPT)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORS OF THE STUDY<|>PERSON<|>The researchers who conducted the study to assess ChatGPT's accuracy in generating systematic review ideas for craniofacial surgery)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY<|>ChatGPT was used to generate systematic review ideas for craniofacial surgery<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHORS OF THE STUDY<|>CHATGPT<|>The authors of the study evaluated ChatGPT's accuracy in generating research ideas<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KOREAN CLEFT PALATE-CRANIOFACIAL ASSOCIATION<|>CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY<|>The association is involved in research and practice related to craniofacial surgery<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
