Our objective was to evaluate the utility of generative LMs in the pediatric critical care setting and to determine whether domain-adapted LMs can outperform much larger general-domain LMs in generating a differential diagnosis from the admission notes of PICU patients. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Quaternary 40-bed PICU. PATIENTS: Notes from all patients admitted to the PICU between January 2012 and April 2023 were used for model development. One hundred thirty randomly selected admission notes were used for evaluation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five experts in critical care used a 5-point Likert scale to independently evaluate the overall quality of differential diagnoses: 1) written by the clinician in the original notes, 2) generated by two general LMs (BioGPT-Large and LLaMa-65B), and 3) generated by two fine-tuned models (fine-tuned BioGPT-Large and fine-tuned LLaMa-7B). Differences among differential diagnoses were compared using mixed methods regression models. We used 1,916,538 notes from 32,454 unique patients for model development and validation. The mean quality scores of the differential diagnoses generated by the clinicians and fine-tuned LLaMa-7B, the best-performing LM, were 3.43 and 2.88, respectively (absolute difference 0.54 units [95% CI, 0.37-0.72], p < 0.001). Fine-tuned LLaMa-7B performed better than LLaMa-65B (absolute difference 0.23 unit [95% CI, 0.06-0.41], p = 0.009) and BioGPT-Large (absolute difference 0.86 unit [95% CI, 0.69-1.0], p < 0.001). The differential diagnosis generated by clinicians and fine-tuned LLaMa-7B were ranked as the highest quality in 144 (55%) and 74 cases (29%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A smaller LM fine-tuned using notes of PICU patients outperformed much larger models trained on general-domain data. Currently, LMs remain inferior but may serve as an adjunct to human clinicians in real-world tasks using real-world data. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.
