This paper explores the utility of language technologies, in deepening the understanding of Health Administrative Claims (HAC) data, a critical healthcare data source containing codes related to healthcare services. HAC data often lack essential clinical details, making it challenging to analyze disease phases, forms and subtypes. However, distinctive patterns of codes within HAC data can potentially signify specific disease phenotypes, making language technologies valuable tools for analysis. To address this, we introduce the “HAC2vec-mean” method, which utilizes skip-gram neural networks to convert HAC sequences into numerical vectors. We employ random forest models for binary and multiclass classification tasks, achieving an Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve of 0.86 for International Classification of Diseases v10. The paper presents data visualizations indicating the effectiveness of the approach in reducing data dimensionality and identifying patterns in patient profiles. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of this approach for cohort selection and index date specification. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of NLP embeddings in enhancing the analysis of HAC data. This flexible framework offers improved insights into patient journeys and healthcare conditions, mitigating the limitations associated with traditional methods. Future work includes exploring the clinical relevance of identified patterns and enhancing explainability. Overall, this research opens doors to uncovering hidden structures with prognostic and therapeutic potential within HAC data. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly large language models, that play a significant role in healthcare applications and data analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large language models are advanced AI systems used in natural language processing and healthcare data analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural Language Processing is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, particularly in analyzing healthcare data)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTH ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS (HAC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Health Administrative Claims data is a critical healthcare data source containing codes related to healthcare services, often lacking clinical details but useful for identifying disease patterns)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAC2VEC-MEAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HAC2vec-mean is a method introduced in the paper that uses skip-gram neural networks to convert HAC sequences into numerical vectors for analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature Switzerland AG is the publisher of the research paper under exclusive license)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>PERSON<|>The author(s) of the research paper conducted the study on NLP embeddings and HAC data analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES V10<|>ORGANIZATION<|>International Classification of Diseases v10 is a coding system used in healthcare for classifying diseases and health conditions)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>Generative AI includes large language models as a key technology for healthcare applications<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>Natural Language Processing utilizes large language models for analyzing healthcare data<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTH ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS (HAC)<|>HAC2VEC-MEAN<|>HAC2vec-mean is a method designed to analyze Health Administrative Claims data<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>The author(s) published their research under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAC2VEC-MEAN<|>INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES V10<|>HAC2vec-mean achieved an Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve of 0.86 for International Classification of Diseases v10<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
