Clinical, research doctors and researchers can use biomedical literature to assess the most recent achievements in a field of study to generate and validate new theories, conduct experiments, and analyze the results. Medical records are difficult to analyze since they are normally presented in plain text, have a very particular technical language, and are almost always unstructured. Due to the ongoing increase of online text resources Document summarization offers a plethora of applications in data extraction and web search. We have done a survey of automatic text summarization techniques. Considering the existing research gaps, we have proposed a model which utilizes BERT and Group Average Linkage clustering on articles taken from PubMed. This work would be helpful for people in the biomedical domain by summarizing huge biomedical texts. It would provide a brief summary by condensing the information in a nutshell, thus saving time.  © 2022 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Biomedical literature is used by clinical and research doctors to assess recent achievements in a field of study, generate and validate new theories, conduct experiments, and analyze results)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBMED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PubMed is a source of biomedical articles used in the proposed model for text summarization)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a model utilized in the proposed text summarization technique for biomedical texts)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUP AVERAGE LINKAGE CLUSTERING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A clustering technique used in the proposed model for summarizing biomedical texts)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IEEE is the organization that published the work in 2022)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE<|>PUBMED<|>Biomedical literature includes articles from PubMed, which are used in the proposed summarization model<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>GROUP AVERAGE LINKAGE CLUSTERING<|>BERT and Group Average Linkage Clustering are combined in the proposed model for summarizing biomedical texts<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBMED<|>BERT<|>PubMed articles are processed using BERT in the proposed summarization model<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBMED<|>GROUP AVERAGE LINKAGE CLUSTERING<|>PubMed articles are clustered using Group Average Linkage Clustering in the proposed model<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE<|>IEEE<|>The work on biomedical literature summarization was published by IEEE in 2022<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
