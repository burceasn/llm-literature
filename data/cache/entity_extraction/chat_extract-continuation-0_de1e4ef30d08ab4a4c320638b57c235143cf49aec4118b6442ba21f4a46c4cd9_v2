It has a wide range of applications, including opinion mining, health informatics, and recommender systems. In the pharmaceutical industry, automatic analysis of people’s online opinions can be used to evaluate a large number of user opinions and extract useful information regarding drug efficacy and risk factors, which can be used to improve pharmacovigilance systems. Approaches for sentiment analysis have evolved over time from simple rules to powerful machine learning techniques such as deep learning, which has emerged as an emerging technology in several natural language processing (NLP) applications. Sentiment analysis is aware of this accomplishment, and various deep learning-based systems have subsequently demonstrated their effectiveness over previous approaches, achieving peak scores on typical sentiment analysis datasets. As transformers have revolutionized the field of NLP, achieving peak scores for different NLP tasks, we propose to combine a pre-trained model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with static embedding model, which has not been studied before. The obtained vectors were used as input features for a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). The experimental results reveal that the proposed model outperforms the state of the art in sentiment analysis of drug reviews. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Sentiment analysis is the process of ranking documents based on their polarity and has applications in opinion mining, health informatics, and recommender systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The pharmaceutical industry uses sentiment analysis to evaluate user opinions on drug efficacy and risk factors to improve pharmacovigilance systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained model used in natural language processing tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature Switzerland AG is the publisher of the research under exclusive license)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS<|>PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY<|>Sentiment analysis is used in the pharmaceutical industry to evaluate drug efficacy and risk factors<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS<|>BERT is a pre-trained model used to improve sentiment analysis tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS<|>Springer Nature Switzerland AG published research on sentiment analysis<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
