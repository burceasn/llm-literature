Focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper navigates through various sections, commencing with an overview of AI’s significance in healthcare and the role of conversational AI. It delves into fundamental NLP techniques, emphasizing their facilitation of seamless healthcare conversations. Examining the evolution of LLMs within NLP frameworks, the paper discusses key models used in healthcare, exploring their advantages and implementation challenges. Practical applications in healthcare conversations, from patient-centric utilities like diagnosis and treatment suggestions to healthcare provider support systems, are detailed. Ethical and legal considerations, including patient privacy, ethical implications, and regulatory compliance, are addressed. The review concludes by spotlighting current challenges, envisaging future trends, and highlighting the transformative potential of LLMs and NLP in reshaping healthcare interactions. © 2024 by the authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
