To make accurate and quick diagnoses, it is possible to use AI tools to efficiently analyze huge amounts of data and find patterns that a clinician might miss. In recent years, new large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Google BARD, have shown remarkable capabilities in several domains, including intelligent diagnostics. This research aims to compare the performances of ChatGPT and traditional machine learning models for making diagnoses of low- and medium- risk diseases only based on their symptoms. On the basis of our study, we defined four research questions: RQ1) What are the benefits and limitations of using ChatGPT in intelligent diagnosis? RQ2) How do traditional machine learning approaches compare to ChatGPT for intelligent diagnosis? RQ3) How does ChatGPT compare with other LLMs and domain-specific natural language processing models in the intelligent diagnosis tasks?, and RQ4) What are the implications of the predictive models and ChatGPT for healthcare, and how can they be used to support people?. To answer these RQs, we first evaluate the performances of different engines of ChatGPT, also introducing a new prompt engineering methodology specifically tailored for achieving accurate diagnostic outcomes. Moreover, we compare these results with those achieved by different predictive models trained for intelligent diagnosis tasks, i.e., Google BARD, and two domain-specific NLP models. Finally, we propose a new interactive bot available for users that relies on the best-performing models evaluated in the previous steps. The experiments have been conducted using two medical datasets for disease prediction consisting of more than 100 symptoms associated with several diagnoses. © 2023 The Author(s)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, used in intelligent diagnosis processes to analyze patient data and medical information for accurate and quick diagnoses.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE BARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google BARD is a large language model developed by Google, used in intelligent diagnosis tasks and compared with ChatGPT and other models in the study.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to techniques and tools used in intelligent diagnosis processes to analyze data and find patterns for accurate diagnoses.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI models, such as ChatGPT and Google BARD, used in intelligent diagnostics and other domains.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOMAIN-SPECIFIC NLP MODELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Domain-specific NLP models are natural language processing models tailored for specific tasks, such as intelligent diagnosis, and compared with ChatGPT in the study.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTELLIGENT DIAGNOSIS<|>EVENT<|>Intelligent diagnosis is a process that uses AI techniques, including ChatGPT and Google BARD, to analyze patient data and provide accurate diagnoses based on symptoms.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCH QUESTIONS (RQS)<|>EVENT<|>Research Questions (RQs) are four key questions defined in the study to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT and other models in intelligent diagnosis tasks.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROMPT ENGINEERING METHODOLOGY<|>EVENT<|>Prompt engineering methodology is a new approach introduced in the study to achieve accurate diagnostic outcomes using ChatGPT.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERACTIVE BOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An interactive bot is a tool proposed in the study that relies on the best-performing models, such as ChatGPT and Google BARD, for intelligent diagnosis tasks.)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>INTELLIGENT DIAGNOSIS<|>ChatGPT is used in intelligent diagnosis processes to analyze patient data and provide accurate diagnoses<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE BARD<|>INTELLIGENT DIAGNOSIS<|>Google BARD is compared with ChatGPT and other models in intelligent diagnosis tasks<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>GOOGLE BARD<|>ChatGPT and Google BARD are compared in the study for their performance in intelligent diagnosis tasks<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>DOMAIN-SPECIFIC NLP MODELS<|>ChatGPT is compared with domain-specific NLP models in intelligent diagnosis tasks<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE BARD<|>DOMAIN-SPECIFIC NLP MODELS<|>Google BARD is compared with domain-specific NLP models in intelligent diagnosis tasks<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>PROMPT ENGINEERING METHODOLOGY<|>A new prompt engineering methodology is introduced to improve ChatGPT's performance in intelligent diagnosis<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERACTIVE BOT<|>CHATGPT<|>The interactive bot relies on ChatGPT and other models for intelligent diagnosis tasks<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERACTIVE BOT<|>GOOGLE BARD<|>The interactive bot relies on Google BARD and other models for intelligent diagnosis tasks<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
