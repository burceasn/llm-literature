As AI tools gain in popularity and their application becomes more ubiquitous, it’s essential to consider how they may affect the future of medical literature. This work aims to describe a number of IT-based tools that contribute to scientific research and writing as ChatGPT, Gemini, Elicit, SCISPACE… Each tool has its own advantages and applications, not to mention shortcomings that can affect the quality of medical research. To conclude artificial intelligence tools have emerged as catalysts for innovation in healthcare research, providing motivation and driving progress even amidst challenges. Therefore, it’s crucial to confront the obstacles related to AI and to tackle ethical and regulatory issues to enhance research quality and scientific output. © 2024; Los autores.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as natural language processing and scientific research assistance)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, widely used in scientific writing and research)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is an AI-based tool developed to assist in scientific writing and research, offering capabilities such as text generation and summarization)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEMINI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gemini is an AI tool used in scientific research and writing, contributing to innovation in healthcare and medical literature)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELICIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Elicit is an AI-based platform designed to assist researchers in scientific writing and data analysis, enhancing the quality of medical research)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCISPACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SCISPACE is an AI tool that supports scientific research and writing, providing resources and insights to improve research output)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDICAL RESEARCH<|>EVENT<|>Medical research refers to the systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources to establish facts and reach new conclusions in healthcare)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCIENTIFIC WRITING<|>EVENT<|>Scientific writing involves the creation of documents that communicate research findings and insights, often enhanced by AI tools like ChatGPT and Elicit)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>Natural Language Processing is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, enabling machines to understand and generate human language<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>CHATGPT<|>ChatGPT is an AI-based tool that leverages Artificial Intelligence to assist in scientific writing and research<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>GEMINI<|>Gemini is an AI tool that utilizes Artificial Intelligence to contribute to healthcare research and innovation<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>ELICIT<|>Elicit is an AI platform that uses Artificial Intelligence to enhance scientific writing and research quality<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>SCISPACE<|>SCISPACE is an AI tool that employs Artificial Intelligence to support scientific research and writing<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>SCIENTIFIC WRITING<|>ChatGPT is used to assist in scientific writing by generating and summarizing text<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEMINI<|>SCIENTIFIC WRITING<|>Gemini contributes to scientific writing by providing tools for research and innovation<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELICIT<|>SCIENTIFIC WRITING<|>Elicit enhances scientific writing by offering data analysis and research assistance<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCISPACE<|>SCIENTIFIC WRITING<|>SCISPACE supports scientific writing by providing resources and insights for researchers<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEDICAL RESEARCH<|>SCIENTIFIC WRITING<|>Scientific writing is a critical component of medical research, communicating findings and insights<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
