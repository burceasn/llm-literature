In the field of echocardiography, AI offers the potential to enhance accuracy, speed up reporting, and reduce the workload of physicians. This is an advantage because, compared to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiograms tend to exhibit higher observer variability in interpretation. This review takes a comprehensive viewpoint at AI-based reporting systems and their application in echocardiography, emphasizing the need for automated diagnoses. The integration of natural language processing (NLP) technologies, including ChatGPT, could provide revolutionary advancements. One of the exciting prospects of AI integration is its potential to accelerate reporting, thereby improving patient outcomes and access to treatment, while also mitigating physician burnout. However, AI introduces new challenges like ensuring data quality, managing potential over-reliance on AI, addressing legal and ethical concerns, and balancing significant costs against benefits. As we navigate these complexities, it's important for cardiologists to stay updated with AI advancements and learn to utilize them effectively. AI has the potential to be integrated into daily clinical practice, becoming a valuable tool for healthcare professionals dealing with heart diseases, provided it's approached with careful consideration. © 2023, Japanese Society of Echocardiography.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
