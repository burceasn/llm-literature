These unstructured complex data include ambiguous medical terms, abbreviations, diagnostic investigation values and dates which pose significant challenges for human and machine learning tasks to process them. This paper proposes a novel approach that transforms clinical text with different writing styles into a uniform and standard presentation using pattern-matching rules and JSON dictionary-based ontologies. The main goal of the proposed approach is to improve the communication between healthcare parties or professionals by improving the quality of the clinical textual data and reducing its heterogeneity and ambiguity. In addition, this data quality improvement enhances the performance of machine learning downstream tasks. Our approach identifies the abbreviations, medical terms, negations, dates, and investigation values from the unstructured textual data. Then, it replaces the detected entities with their corresponding unified and normalized presentation based on pattern-matching rules that relies on the linguistic features, pattern-matching rules, and JSON dictionaries. The inductive content analysis method was followed to generate the pattern-matching rules with the help of a medical team. Its role is to validate the accuracy of the detected entities. Finally, the proposed approach was applied to a massive real-world dataset in order to evaluate its impact on the performance of various machine learning models. The results show a significant improvement in performance after preprocessing the clinical textual data using our approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CLINICAL TEXTUAL DATA<|>EVENT<|>Clinical textual data refers to unstructured data such as discharge summaries and chief complaints that summarize a patient’s medical history and treatment plan, posing challenges for processing due to ambiguity and heterogeneity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATTERN-MATCHING RULES<|>EVENT<|>Pattern-matching rules are used to transform clinical text into a uniform and standard presentation by identifying and replacing ambiguous terms, abbreviations, and other entities with normalized forms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JSON DICTIONARY-BASED ONTOLOGIES<|>EVENT<|>JSON dictionary-based ontologies are used alongside pattern-matching rules to standardize clinical textual data by providing a unified representation of detected entities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDICAL TEAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A medical team validates the accuracy of detected entities in clinical textual data and assists in generating pattern-matching rules)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature Switzerland AG is the publisher of the paper under exclusive license, which discusses the proposed approach for improving clinical textual data quality)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINICAL TEXTUAL DATA<|>PATTERN-MATCHING RULES<|>Pattern-matching rules are applied to clinical textual data to standardize and improve its quality<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINICAL TEXTUAL DATA<|>JSON DICTIONARY-BASED ONTOLOGIES<|>JSON dictionary-based ontologies are used to normalize and unify entities in clinical textual data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATTERN-MATCHING RULES<|>JSON DICTIONARY-BASED ONTOLOGIES<|>Pattern-matching rules and JSON dictionary-based ontologies work together to standardize clinical textual data<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEDICAL TEAM<|>PATTERN-MATCHING RULES<|>The medical team validates the accuracy of pattern-matching rules and assists in their generation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEDICAL TEAM<|>CLINICAL TEXTUAL DATA<|>The medical team plays a role in improving the quality of clinical textual data by validating detected entities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>CLINICAL TEXTUAL DATA<|>Springer Nature Switzerland AG published the paper discussing the approach to improve clinical textual data quality<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
