This systematic review aims to evaluate the current applications of NLP and LLMs in rheumatology, focusing on their potential to improve disease detection, diagnosis and patient management. Methods: We screened seven databases. We included original research articles that evaluated the performance of NLP models in rheumatology. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies was used to evaluate the risk of bias. Results: Of 1491 articles initially identified, 35 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies utilized various data types, including electronic medical records and clinical notes, and employed models like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and Generative Pre-trained Transformers. High accuracy was observed in detecting conditions such as RA, SpAs and gout. The use of NLP also showed promise in managing diseases and predicting flares. Conclusion: NLP showed significant potential in enhancing rheumatology by improving diagnostic accuracy and personalizing patient care. While applications in detecting diseases like RA and gout are well developed, further research is needed to extend these technologies to rarer and more complex clinical conditions. Overcoming current limitations through targeted research is essential for fully realizing NLP's potential in clinical practice. © 2024 The Author(s).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of study and technology used in healthcare for analyzing unstructured clinical texts and improving disease detection, diagnosis, and patient management)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large language models (LLMs) are advanced tools used in healthcare, particularly in rheumatology, to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHEUMATOLOGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rheumatology is a medical field focused on diagnosing and managing rheumatic diseases, where NLP and LLMs are being applied to improve outcomes)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a model used in NLP for analyzing clinical texts in rheumatology)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) are models used in NLP for analyzing clinical texts and improving disease detection in rheumatology)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RA<|>EVENT<|>RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) is a condition detected and managed using NLP and LLMs in rheumatology)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPAS<|>EVENT<|>SpAs (Spondyloarthropathies) are conditions detected and managed using NLP and LLMs in rheumatology)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOUT<|>EVENT<|>Gout is a condition detected and managed using NLP and LLMs in rheumatology)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>RHEUMATOLOGY<|>NLP is applied in rheumatology to improve disease detection, diagnosis, and patient management<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS<|>RHEUMATOLOGY<|>LLMs are applied in rheumatology to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>BERT is a model used in NLP for analyzing clinical texts<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMERS<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>GPT is a model used in NLP for analyzing clinical texts<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RA<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>RA is a condition detected and managed using NLP<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPAS<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>SpAs are conditions detected and managed using NLP<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOUT<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>Gout is a condition detected and managed using NLP<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
