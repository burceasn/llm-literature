Design/methods: We searched seven electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and Web of Science) from November 2022 until September 2023. This scoping review adhered to Arksey and O'Malley's framework and followed reporting guidelines outlined in the PRISMA-ScR checklist. For analysis, we employed Thomas and Harden's thematic synthesis framework. Results: A total of 100 studies were included. An overarching theme, “Forging the Future: Bridging Theory and Integration of ChatGPT” emerged, accompanied by two main themes (1) Enhancing Healthcare Education, Research, and Writing with ChatGPT, (2) Controversies and Concerns about ChatGPT in Healthcare Education Research and Writing, and seven subthemes. Conclusions: Our review underscores the importance of acknowledging legitimate concerns related to the potential misuse of ChatGPT such as ‘ChatGPT hallucinations’, its limited understanding of specialized healthcare knowledge, its impact on teaching methods and assessments, confidentiality and security risks, and the controversial practice of crediting it as a co-author on scientific papers, among other considerations. Furthermore, our review also recognizes the urgency of establishing timely guidelines and regulations, along with the active engagement of relevant stakeholders, to ensure the responsible and safe implementation of ChatGPT's capabilities. We advocate for the use of cross-verification techniques to enhance the precision and reliability of generated content, the adaptation of higher education curricula to incorporate ChatGPT's potential, educators' need to familiarize themselves with the technology to improve their literacy and teaching approaches, and the development of innovative methods to detect ChatGPT usage. Furthermore, data protection measures should be prioritized when employing ChatGPT, and transparent reporting becomes crucial when integrating ChatGPT into academic writing. © 2024 The Author(s)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is an AI tool used in healthcare education and research, with potential benefits and concerns such as misuse, limited understanding of specialized healthcare knowledge, and security risks)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARKSEY AND O'MALLEY<|>PERSON<|>Arksey and O'Malley are researchers whose framework was used in the scoping review)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOMAS AND HARDEN<|>PERSON<|>Thomas and Harden are researchers whose thematic synthesis framework was employed for analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRISMA-SCR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PRISMA-ScR is a reporting guideline used in the scoping review)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBMED/MEDLINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PubMed/Medline is one of the electronic databases searched for the review)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINAHL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CINAHL is one of the electronic databases searched for the review)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Embase is one of the electronic databases searched for the review)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSYCINFO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PsycINFO is one of the electronic databases searched for the review)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scopus is one of the electronic databases searched for the review)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROQUEST DISSERTATIONS AND THESES GLOBAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global is one of the electronic databases searched for the review)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEB OF SCIENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Web of Science is one of the electronic databases searched for the review)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCARE EDUCATION<|>EVENT<|>Healthcare education is a field where ChatGPT is being integrated, with potential benefits and concerns)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCIENTIFIC PAPERS<|>EVENT<|>Scientific papers are a context where ChatGPT's use, including as a co-author, is controversial)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>HEALTHCARE EDUCATION<|>ChatGPT is being integrated into healthcare education, with potential benefits and concerns<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>SCIENTIFIC PAPERS<|>ChatGPT's use in scientific papers, including as a co-author, is controversial<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARKSEY AND O'MALLEY<|>PRISMA-SCR<|>Arksey and O'Malley's framework was used alongside PRISMA-ScR guidelines in the scoping review<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOMAS AND HARDEN<|>CHATGPT<|>Thomas and Harden's thematic synthesis framework was used to analyze ChatGPT's role in healthcare education and research<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBMED/MEDLINE<|>CHATGPT<|>PubMed/Medline was one of the databases searched for studies on ChatGPT in healthcare education and research<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINAHL<|>CHATGPT<|>CINAHL was one of the databases searched for studies on ChatGPT in healthcare education and research<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMBASE<|>CHATGPT<|>Embase was one of the databases searched for studies on ChatGPT in healthcare education and research<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PSYCINFO<|>CHATGPT<|>PsycINFO was one of the databases searched for studies on ChatGPT in healthcare education and research<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOPUS<|>CHATGPT<|>Scopus was one of the databases searched for studies on ChatGPT in healthcare education and research<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROQUEST DISSERTATIONS AND THESES GLOBAL<|>CHATGPT<|>ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global was one of the databases searched for studies on ChatGPT in healthcare education and research<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEB OF SCIENCE<|>CHATGPT<|>Web of Science was one of the databases searched for studies on ChatGPT in healthcare education and research<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
