It often causes diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), which affect millions of people and increase amputation and mortality rates. Despite existing guidelines, the complexity of DFU treatment makes clinical decisions challenging. Large language models such as chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT), which are adept at natural language processing, have emerged as valuable resources in the medical field. However, concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the information they provide remain. We aimed to assess the accuracy of various artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, including ChatGPT, in providing information on DFUs based on established guidelines. Seven AI chatbots were asked clinical questions (CQs) based on the DFU guidelines. Their responses were analyzed for accuracy in terms of answers to CQs, grade of recommendation, level of evidence, and agreement with the reference, including verification of the authenticity of the references provided by the chatbots. The AI chatbots showed a mean accuracy of 91.2% in answers to CQs, with discrepancies noted in grade of recommendation and level of evidence. Claude-2 outperformed other chatbots in the number of verified references (99.6%), whereas ChatGPT had the lowest rate of reference authenticity (66.3%). This study highlights the potential of AI chatbots as tools for disseminating medical information and demonstrates their high degree of accuracy in answering CQs related to DFUs. However, the variability in the accuracy of these chatbots and problems like AI hallucinations necessitate cautious use and further optimization for medical applications. This study underscores the evolving role of AI in healthcare and the importance of refining these technologies for effective use in clinical decision-making and patient education. © The Author(s) 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TYPE 2 DIABETES<|>EVENT<|>Type 2 diabetes is a significant global health concern that often causes diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), affecting millions of people and increasing amputation and mortality rates)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS (DFUS)<|>EVENT<|>Diabetic foot ulcers are a complication of Type 2 diabetes, affecting millions of people and increasing the risk of amputation and mortality)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a large language model adept at natural language processing, used in the medical field to provide information on DFUs, though concerns about its accuracy and reliability remain)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLAUDE-2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Claude-2 is an AI chatbot that outperformed other chatbots in the study, achieving a 99.6% rate of verified references in providing information on DFUs)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AI CHATBOTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI chatbots, including ChatGPT and Claude-2, were assessed for their accuracy in providing information on DFUs based on established guidelines, showing a mean accuracy of 91.2%)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYPE 2 DIABETES<|>DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS (DFUS)<|>Type 2 diabetes often causes diabetic foot ulcers, which are a significant health concern<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>AI CHATBOTS<|>ChatGPT is one of the AI chatbots assessed in the study for its accuracy in providing information on DFUs<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLAUDE-2<|>AI CHATBOTS<|>Claude-2 is one of the AI chatbots assessed in the study, outperforming others in verified references<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AI CHATBOTS<|>DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS (DFUS)<|>AI chatbots were assessed for their accuracy in providing information on DFUs based on established guidelines<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
