In this study, we explore two modalities of breast images, ultrasound, and histology, for their classification into cancerous and non-cancerous categories. Traditionally Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) have done a commendable job of extracting features using convolution kernels from images with great accuracy. Also, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has been widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for feature encoding and downstream tasks like segmentation and classification. We extract the power of Vision Transformers (ViT) and implement transfer learning using BERT pre-training of Image Transformers (BEiT) as a feature encoding technique. We use the encoded features for classification with Recurrent Neural Network – Long short Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). The classification is performed on two modalities of breast image datasets: BUSI1311 and breast histopathological images. Both modalities yielded competitive accuracies. The BUSI1311 dataset produced 99 percent accuracy compared to 91 percent accuracy for breast histology images. © 2023 The Author(s)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI is a technology used in computer-aided diagnostic systems to assist radiologists in cancer diagnosis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CNN is a type of neural network used for extracting features from images with high accuracy)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a model widely used in Natural Language Processing for feature encoding and tasks like segmentation and classification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VISION TRANSFORMERS (VIT)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ViT is a model used for image classification and feature extraction)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMAGE TRANSFORMERS (BEIT)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BEiT is a pre-training technique for image transformers used in feature encoding)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK – LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY (RNN-LSTM)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RNN-LSTM is a neural network architecture used for classification tasks)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSI1311<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BUSI1311 is a dataset of breast ultrasound images used for classification in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAST HISTOPATHOLOGICAL IMAGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A dataset of breast histology images used for classification in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>PERSON<|>The author(s) of the study published in 2023)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN)<|>AI utilizes CNN for feature extraction from images<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT)<|>VISION TRANSFORMERS (VIT)<|>BERT is used for pre-training ViT in the study<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMAGE TRANSFORMERS (BEIT)<|>VISION TRANSFORMERS (VIT)<|>BEiT is a pre-training technique applied to ViT<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK – LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY (RNN-LSTM)<|>IMAGE TRANSFORMERS (BEIT)<|>RNN-LSTM uses encoded features from BEiT for classification<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUSI1311<|>BREAST HISTOPATHOLOGICAL IMAGES<|>Both datasets are used for classification in the study<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>The author(s) conducted a study involving AI for cancer diagnosis<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
