This technique has the potential to improve the efficiency of medical professionals while relieving the burden on the public health system, particularly in resource-poor countries. However, existing medical VQA datasets are small and only contain simple questions (equivalent to classification tasks), which lack semantic reasoning and clinical knowledge. Our previous work proposed a clinical knowledge-driven image difference VQA benchmark using a rule-based approach (Hu et al., 2023). However, given the same breadth of information coverage, the rule-based approach shows an 85% error rate on extracted labels. We trained an LLM method to extract labels with 62% increased accuracy. We also comprehensively evaluated our labels with 2 clinical experts on 100 samples to help us fine-tune the LLM. Based on the trained LLM model, we proposed a large-scale medical VQA dataset, Medical-CXR-VQA, using LLMs focused on chest X-ray images. The questions involved detailed information, such as abnormalities, locations, levels, and types. Based on this dataset, we proposed a novel VQA method by constructing three different relationship graphs: spatial relationships, semantic relationships, and implicit relationship graphs on the image regions, questions, and semantic labels. We leveraged graph attention to learn the logical reasoning paths for different questions. These learned graph VQA reasoning paths can be further used for LLM prompt engineering and chain-of-thought, which are crucial for further fine-tuning and training multi-modal large language models. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach has the qualities of evidence and faithfulness, which are crucial in the clinical field.
