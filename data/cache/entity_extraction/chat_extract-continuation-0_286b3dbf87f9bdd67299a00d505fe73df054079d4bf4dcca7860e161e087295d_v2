OpenAI's recent release, ChatGPT, uses a transformer-based model to enable human-like text generation and question-answering on general domain knowledge, while a healthcare-specific Large Language Model (LLM) such as GatorTron has focused on the real-world healthcare domain knowledge. As LLMs advance to achieve near human-level performances on medical question and answering benchmarks, it is probable that Conversational AI will soon be developed for use in healthcare. In this article we discuss the potential and compare the performance of two different approaches to generative pretrained transformers—ChatGPT, the most widely used general conversational LLM, and Foresight, a GPT (generative pretrained transformer) based model focused on modelling patients and disorders. The comparison is conducted on the task of forecasting relevant diagnoses based on clinical vignettes. We also discuss important considerations and limitations of transformer-based chatbots for clinical use. 2023 Au Yeung, Kraljevic, Luintel, Balston, Idowu, Dobson and Teo.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OPENAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenAI is the organization behind the development of ChatGPT, a transformer-based model for human-like text generation and question-answering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a widely used general conversational large language model (LLM) developed by OpenAI, capable of human-like text generation and question-answering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GATORTRON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GatorTron is a healthcare-specific large language model (LLM) focused on real-world healthcare domain knowledge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORESIGHT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Foresight is a GPT-based model focused on modeling patients and disorders, used for forecasting relevant diagnoses based on clinical vignettes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AU YEUNG<|>PERSON<|>Au Yeung is one of the authors of the article discussing the potential and performance of transformer-based chatbots in healthcare)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRALJEVIC<|>PERSON<|>Kraljevic is one of the authors of the article discussing the potential and performance of transformer-based chatbots in healthcare)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUINTEL<|>PERSON<|>Luintel is one of the authors of the article discussing the potential and performance of transformer-based chatbots in healthcare)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALSTON<|>PERSON<|>Balston is one of the authors of the article discussing the potential and performance of transformer-based chatbots in healthcare)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IDOWU<|>PERSON<|>Idowu is one of the authors of the article discussing the potential and performance of transformer-based chatbots in healthcare)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOBSON<|>PERSON<|>Dobson is one of the authors of the article discussing the potential and performance of transformer-based chatbots in healthcare)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEO<|>PERSON<|>Teo is one of the authors of the article discussing the potential and performance of transformer-based chatbots in healthcare)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENAI<|>CHATGPT<|>OpenAI developed ChatGPT, a transformer-based model for human-like text generation and question-answering<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>FORESIGHT<|>ChatGPT and Foresight are both GPT-based models compared in the article for their performance in forecasting relevant diagnoses based on clinical vignettes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GATORTRON<|>CHATGPT<|>GatorTron and ChatGPT are both large language models (LLMs), with GatorTron focused on healthcare domain knowledge and ChatGPT on general domain knowledge<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AU YEUNG<|>CHATGPT<|>Au Yeung is one of the authors discussing the potential and performance of ChatGPT in healthcare<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRALJEVIC<|>CHATGPT<|>Kraljevic is one of the authors discussing the potential and performance of ChatGPT in healthcare<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUINTEL<|>CHATGPT<|>Luintel is one of the authors discussing the potential and performance of ChatGPT in healthcare<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BALSTON<|>CHATGPT<|>Balston is one of the authors discussing the potential and performance of ChatGPT in healthcare<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDOWU<|>CHATGPT<|>Idowu is one of the authors discussing the potential and performance of ChatGPT in healthcare<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOBSON<|>CHATGPT<|>Dobson is one of the authors discussing the potential and performance of ChatGPT in healthcare<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEO<|>CHATGPT<|>Teo is one of the authors discussing the potential and performance of ChatGPT in healthcare<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
