Some topics such as data labelling, data curation, human-in-the-loop, explainability or privacy-preserving methodologies are hot topics for applied machine learning in the healthcare context. In this domain, we normally expect a three-way interaction (doctor-system-patient), so that interfaces play a crucial role. Remotely managed VR (Virtual Reality) systems help us to enhance communication and feedback between doctors and patients in situations where in-person assistance is not feasible. Moreover, the recent breakthroughs with LLMs (Large Language Models) enable us to use natural language as additional interface, considering NLU (Natural Language Understanding) for intent recognition, ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-To-Speech). In the context of the CEL.IA network, we present IVAMED (Intelligent Virtual Assistant for MEdical Diagnosis), a chatbot-oriented application in a VR environment for remote medical assistance. We tackle the situation in which face-to-face assistance is not possible. We provide the tools for remote interaction and guided diagnosis. We propose the evaluation of the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) test for early detection of MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and the BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) test for measuring characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression.  © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CEL.IA NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CEL.IA Network is an organization presenting IVAMED, a chatbot-oriented application in a VR environment for remote medical assistance)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IVAMED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IVAMED (Intelligent Virtual Assistant for MEdical Diagnosis) is a chatbot-oriented application in a VR environment for remote medical assistance, developed within the CEL.IA Network)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOCA<|>EVENT<|>MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) is a test proposed for early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI))  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BDI<|>EVENT<|>BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) is a test proposed for measuring characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LLMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LLMs (Large Language Models) are advanced AI systems enabling natural language interfaces for applications like IVAMED)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CEL.IA NETWORK<|>IVAMED<|>CEL.IA Network developed and presented IVAMED as a solution for remote medical assistance<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IVAMED<|>MOCA<|>IVAMED proposes the use of the MoCA test for early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IVAMED<|>BDI<|>IVAMED proposes the use of the BDI test for measuring symptoms of depression<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IVAMED<|>LLMS<|>IVAMED leverages LLMs for natural language interfaces in its VR environment<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
