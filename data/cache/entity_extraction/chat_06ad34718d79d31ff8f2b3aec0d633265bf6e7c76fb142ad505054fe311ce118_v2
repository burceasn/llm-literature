It is a serious public health problem, and the right prompt response can mitigate it. Therefore, identifying individuals with suicide risk and offering immediate counseling to everyone that might need it is a crucial step. In this research, we utilize personal narratives collected through the popular social media website (Reddit) to build a model suitable for predicting suicide ideation in a sample of Twitter users that is representative for the Canadian population. The labeled dataset contains only 621 users, and with that limited number of training instances we extracted features for classical machine learning and achieved an F1-score of 0.922 using linguistic and emotion features. In addition, we fine-tuned a Sentence Pair Classification BERT model and achieved 92.6 F1-score. The classical machine learning trained model was applied on Canadian population representative dataset. The geographic and demographic patterns of suicide ideation correlate with the suicide statistics reported by Statistics Canada for 2015. © 2021 J. Adv. Inf.
