ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing AI model which has shown impressive capabilities, scoring in the top percentiles on numerous standardized examinations, including the Uniform Bar Exam and Scholastic Aptitude Test. The goal of this study was to evaluate ChatGPT performance on the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE), an assessment of medical knowledge for orthopedic residents.Methods:OITE 2020, 2021, and 2022 questions without images were inputted into ChatGPT version 3.5 and version 4 (GPT-4) with zero prompting. The performance of ChatGPT was evaluated as a percentage of correct responses and compared with the national average of orthopedic surgery residents at each postgraduate year (PGY) level. ChatGPT was asked to provide a source for its answer, which was categorized as being a journal article, book, or website, and if the source could be verified. Impact factor for the journal cited was also recorded.Results:ChatGPT answered 196 of 360 answers correctly (54.3%), corresponding to a PGY-1 level. ChatGPT cited a verifiable source in 47.2% of questions, with an average median journal impact factor of 5.4. GPT-4 answered 265 of 360 questions correctly (73.6%), corresponding to the average performance of a PGY-5 and exceeding the corresponding passing score for the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery Part I Examination of 67%. GPT-4 cited a verifiable source in 87.9% of questions, with an average median journal impact factor of 5.2.Conclusions:ChatGPT performed above the average PGY-1 level and GPT-4 performed better than the average PGY-5 level, showing major improvement. Further investigation is needed to determine how successive versions of ChatGPT would perform and how to optimize this technology to improve medical education.Clinical Relevance:AI has the potential to aid in medical education and healthcare delivery. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing AI model that has shown impressive capabilities in standardized examinations, including the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE))  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT-4<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPT-4 is an advanced version of ChatGPT that performed better than the average PGY-5 level on the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE))  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORTHOPAEDIC IN-TRAINING EXAMINATION (OITE)<|>EVENT<|>The OITE is an assessment of medical knowledge for orthopedic residents, used to evaluate ChatGPT and GPT-4 performance)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN BOARD OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery sets passing scores for examinations, including the Part I Examination)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lippincott Williams & Wilkins is the publisher of the study evaluating ChatGPT and GPT-4 performance on the OITE)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORTHOPAEDIC IN-TRAINING EXAMINATION (OITE)<|>ChatGPT was evaluated on the OITE, scoring at a PGY-1 level<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-4<|>ORTHOPAEDIC IN-TRAINING EXAMINATION (OITE)<|>GPT-4 was evaluated on the OITE, scoring at a PGY-5 level<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>GPT-4<|>GPT-4 is an advanced version of ChatGPT, showing improved performance on the OITE<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>AMERICAN BOARD OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY<|>ChatGPT's performance was compared to the passing score set by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-4<|>AMERICAN BOARD OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY<|>GPT-4's performance exceeded the passing score set by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS<|>Lippincott Williams & Wilkins published the study evaluating ChatGPT's performance<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-4<|>LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS<|>Lippincott Williams & Wilkins published the study evaluating GPT-4's performance<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
