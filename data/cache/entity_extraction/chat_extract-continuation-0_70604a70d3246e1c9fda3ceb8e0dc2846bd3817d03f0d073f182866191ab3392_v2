Accordingly, this study aimed to delineate the merits and demerits of ChatGPT within the realm of research. Methods: A meta-synthesis methodology involving a seven-step process was adopted to pursue the research objectives. Data were collected from comprehensive studies across specialized research databases, such as Science Direct, Springer, Eric, Emerald, Sage Journals, Wiley Online Library, PubMed, and Google Scholar, within the time frame spanning from 2022 to 2023. A total of 57 articles were meticulously chosen for analysis through judgmental sampling. Subsequently, key concepts were distilled from these articles and categorized using the thematic analysis approach while considering Karl Llewellyn’s octagonal model from 1963. Results: The outcomes underwent scrutiny employing the thematic analysis strategy devised by Wolcott. The results about the capabilities and constraints of ChatGPT encompass eight dimensions, including formulating the research problem, reviewing relevant literature, selecting an appropriate research design, defining the population and choosing the sample, collecting data, analyzing data, interpreting data, and discussing and drawing conclusions. The credibility of these dimensions was substantiated through adherence to the criteria established by Lincoln and Guba. Conclusion: ChatGPT manifests myriad potentialities and constraints within the research purview based on the results. In light of the expeditious progression of artificial intelligence across multifarious domains, integrating this technological paradigm in research becomes an inexorable imperative, and excluding its use in research is untenable. Thus, policymakers and higher education strategists should devise policies that harness ChatGPT’s potential in research endeavors, engendering many opportunities. © Journal of Advances in Medical Education & Professionalism.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence tool discussed in the study for its utility, challenges, and opportunities in research)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCIENCE DIRECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Science Direct is a specialized research database used for data collection in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer is a specialized research database used for data collection in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eric is a specialized research database used for data collection in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMERALD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Emerald is a specialized research database used for data collection in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAGE JOURNALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sage Journals is a specialized research database used for data collection in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILEY ONLINE LIBRARY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wiley Online Library is a specialized research database used for data collection in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBMED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PubMed is a specialized research database used for data collection in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE SCHOLAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Scholar is a specialized research database used for data collection in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KARL LLEWELLYN<|>PERSON<|>Karl Llewellyn is the creator of the octagonal model from 1963, referenced in the study for thematic analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOLCOTT<|>PERSON<|>Wolcott is the developer of the thematic analysis strategy used to scrutinize the study's outcomes)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINCOLN<|>PERSON<|>Lincoln is one of the creators of the criteria used to substantiate the credibility of the study's dimensions)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUBA<|>PERSON<|>Guba is one of the creators of the criteria used to substantiate the credibility of the study's dimensions)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION & PROFESSIONALISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The journal where the study was published)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>SCIENCE DIRECT<|>ChatGPT's utility in research was analyzed using data collected from Science Direct<|>4)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>SPRINGER<|>ChatGPT's utility in research was analyzed using data collected from Springer<|>4)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ERIC<|>ChatGPT's utility in research was analyzed using data collected from Eric<|>4)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>EMERALD<|>ChatGPT's utility in research was analyzed using data collected from Emerald<|>4)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>SAGE JOURNALS<|>ChatGPT's utility in research was analyzed using data collected from Sage Journals<|>4)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>WILEY ONLINE LIBRARY<|>ChatGPT's utility in research was analyzed using data collected from Wiley Online Library<|>4)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>PUBMED<|>ChatGPT's utility in research was analyzed using data collected from PubMed<|>4)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>GOOGLE SCHOLAR<|>ChatGPT's utility in research was analyzed using data collected from Google Scholar<|>4)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KARL LLEWELLYN<|>CHATGPT<|>Karl Llewellyn's octagonal model was used to categorize key concepts in the study about ChatGPT<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WOLCOTT<|>CHATGPT<|>Wolcott's thematic analysis strategy was used to scrutinize the outcomes of the study about ChatGPT<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINCOLN<|>CHATGPT<|>Lincoln's criteria were used to substantiate the credibility of the study's dimensions about ChatGPT<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUBA<|>CHATGPT<|>Guba's criteria were used to substantiate the credibility of the study's dimensions about ChatGPT<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION & PROFESSIONALISM<|>The study about ChatGPT was published in the Journal of Advances in Medical Education & Professionalism<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
