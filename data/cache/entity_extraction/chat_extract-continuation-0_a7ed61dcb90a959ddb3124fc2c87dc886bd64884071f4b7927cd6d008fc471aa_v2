The care teams are receiving a rising number of patient portal messages (PPMs) generated by patients as the increase of patient engagement in patient portal, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It opens great opportunities to develop artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to supports the care teams and reduce their workload. Previous studies have shown the potential of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) for classification of PPMs to automate message triage. Recent progress in neural network architectures (e.g., the Transformer) and the emergence of large-scale pre-trained language models are pushing the state-of-the-art for multiple NLP tasks including text classification. However, there has been very little research studies about the performance of pre-trained language models for the PPMs classification task. This study proposes to investigate the performance of multiple state-of-the-art NLP pre-trained language models based on the language style and the nature of content for the multi-category PPMs classification task. The results could contribute to developing future advanced and precise triage system of PPMs for clinical applications. We developed PPM classifiers leveraging five popular Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language models including the generic BERT models (BERT and RoBERTa), domain-specific BERT models (BioBERT and Bio-ClinicalBERT), and source-specific BERT model (BERTweet), which were pre-trained with corpus in different domain and from different sources. The BERT-based models were fine-tuned and evaluated with an annotated corpus of 2239 annotated PPMs with four categories. Our results show that source-specific model BERTweet outperformed all other tested models, with a 0.78 accuracy score and a 0.75 F-1 score. Both domain-specific models BioBERT and Bio-ClinicalBERT achieved better results (F1 scores of 0.74 and 0.72), compared with the generic models BERT and RoBERTa (F-1 scores of 0.70 and 0.66), respectively. BERTweet gained the benefit from the large-scale English tweets pre-train corpus which has informal and colloquial language similar to PPMs. The domain specific models BioBERT and Bio-ClinicalBERT performed better than the generic models because they were pre-trained with large-scale biomedical and clinical corpora and can learn better representation of PPMs for better recognition of health concepts. The results show that the language models pre-trained by a corpus with similar language style and domain concepts are beneficial to the downstream PPM classification. It would be worth to explore the combination of multiple featured language models in order to further improve the model performance. © 2023 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PATIENT PORTAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A secure platform enabling patients to access medical records and communicate with care teams for healthcare issues)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARE TEAMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Healthcare teams receiving patient portal messages (PPMs) and providing support to patients)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>A global pandemic that increased patient engagement in patient portals)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Technology developed to support care teams and reduce workload by automating tasks like PPM classification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A field of AI used for tasks like classifying patient portal messages)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A subfield of AI focused on understanding and processing human language, used for PPM classification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSFORMER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A neural network architecture used in NLP tasks, including text classification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pre-trained language model used for NLP tasks, including PPM classification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A generic pre-trained language model based on BERT architecture)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOBERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A domain-specific BERT model pre-trained on biomedical corpora)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIO-CLINICALBERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A domain-specific BERT model pre-trained on clinical corpora)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERTWEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A source-specific BERT model pre-trained on English tweets, used for PPM classification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization publishing the study on PPM classification using pre-trained language models)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATIENT PORTAL<|>CARE TEAMS<|>The patient portal enables communication between patients and care teams<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARE TEAMS<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The COVID-19 pandemic increased the number of PPMs received by care teams<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>CARE TEAMS<|>AI solutions are being developed to support care teams and reduce their workload<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>Machine learning is used in NLP tasks like PPM classification<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSFORMER<|>BERT<|>BERT is based on the Transformer architecture<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>ROBERTA<|>RoBERTa is a variant of the BERT model<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>BIOBERT<|>BioBERT is a domain-specific version of BERT<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>BIO-CLINICALBERT<|>Bio-ClinicalBERT is a domain-specific version of BERT<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>BERTWEET<|>BERTweet is a source-specific version of BERT<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERTWEET<|>PATIENT PORTAL<|>BERTweet was used to classify PPMs from the patient portal<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOBERT<|>PATIENT PORTAL<|>BioBERT was used to classify PPMs from the patient portal<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIO-CLINICALBERT<|>PATIENT PORTAL<|>Bio-ClinicalBERT was used to classify PPMs from the patient portal<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERTA<|>PATIENT PORTAL<|>RoBERTa was used to classify PPMs from the patient portal<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>PATIENT PORTAL<|>BERT was used to classify PPMs from the patient portal<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IEEE<|>STUDY<|>The study on PPM classification was published by IEEE<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
