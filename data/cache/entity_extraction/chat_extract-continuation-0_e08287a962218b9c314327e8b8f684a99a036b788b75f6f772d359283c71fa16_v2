These innovative technologies promise to deliver rapid and personalized services to key stakeholders, including educators, healthcare professionals, students, and patients. This paper presents a rigorous scoping review of prior research on the application of ChatGPT in the education and healthcare sectors. The comprehensive review methodology involved a meticulous analysis of 71 articles from reputable digital databases. The outcomes of this review provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing body of research related to the applications of ChatGPT in education and healthcare, encompassing insights from previous studies, a discussion of encountered limitations and challenges, exploration of potential research directions for implementing ChatGPT technology, and a deeper analysis of the ethical implications of its use and how to address them. We discuss the implications of these findings and recommendations, contributing to a growing body of knowledge regarding the application of artificial intelligence in these vital and sensitive sectors.  © 2013 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is an advanced system integrating artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies, widely adopted in education and healthcare sectors for delivering rapid and personalized services)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EDUCATION<|>EVENT<|>A sector where ChatGPT is applied to provide personalized services to educators and students)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCARE<|>EVENT<|>A sector where ChatGPT is applied to provide personalized services to healthcare professionals and patients)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A reputable organization associated with the publication of the research paper on ChatGPT's applications in education and healthcare)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>EDUCATION<|>ChatGPT is applied in the education sector to deliver personalized services to educators and students<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>HEALTHCARE<|>ChatGPT is applied in the healthcare sector to deliver personalized services to healthcare professionals and patients<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>IEEE<|>The research paper on ChatGPT's applications in education and healthcare is associated with IEEE<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>EDUCATION<|>HEALTHCARE<|>Both sectors are key areas where ChatGPT is applied to provide personalized services<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
