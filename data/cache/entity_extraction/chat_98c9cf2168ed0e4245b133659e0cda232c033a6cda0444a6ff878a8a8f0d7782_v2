Women often use the Internet or social networking sites to seek information related to pregnancy in different stages. They may ask questions about birth control, trying to conceive, labor, or taking care of a newborn or baby. Classifying different types of questions about pregnancy information (e.g., before, during, and after pregnancy) can inform the design of social media and professional websites for pregnancy education and support. This research aims to investigate the attention mechanism built-in or added on top of the BERT model in classifying and annotating the pregnancy-related questions posted on a community QA site. We evaluated two BERT-based models and compared them against the traditional machine learning models for question classification. Most importantly, we investigated two attention mechanisms: the built-in selfattention mechanism of BERT and the additional attention layer on top of BERT for relevant term annotation. The classification performance showed that the BERT-based models worked better than the traditional models, and BERT with an additional attention layer can achieve higher overall precision than the basic BERT model. The results also showed that both attention mechanisms work differently on annotating relevant content, and they could serve as feature selection methods for text mining in general. © 2020 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
