Pharmacoepidemiologists can bring essential methodological rigor and study design expertise to the design and use of these technologies within healthcare settings. AI/ML-based tools also play a role in pharmacoepidemiology research, as we may apply them to answer our own research questions, take responsibility for evaluating medical devices with AI/ML components, or participate in interdisciplinary research to create new AI/ML algorithms. While epidemiologic expertise is essential to deploying AI/ML responsibly and ethically, the rapid advancement of these technologies in the past decade has resulted in a knowledge gap for many in the field. This article provides a brief overview of core AI/ML concepts, followed by a discussion of potential applications of AI/ML in pharmacoepidemiology research, and closes with a review of important concepts across application areas, including interpretability and fairness. This review is intended to provide an accessible, practical overview of AI/ML for pharmacoepidemiology research, with references to further, more detailed resources on fundamental topics. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
