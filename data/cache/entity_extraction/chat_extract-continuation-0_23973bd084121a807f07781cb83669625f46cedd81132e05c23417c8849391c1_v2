The models were trained and fine-tuned on a patient-doctor question-answer dataset [1]. The metrics used for performance evaluation include ROUGE, Elo rating, Winning percentage, and Expert evaluation. The comparative analysis results indicate that the SambaLingo-Turkish-Chat model was successful in terms of response accuracy and contextual relevance, while the Trendyol-LLM-7b-chat-v 1.8 model proved to be more successful when considering the ethical aspects of the task [14], [17]. This study demonstrates the potential of AI-powered virtual doctor assistants in Turkish healthcare services and contributes to the development of Turkish-specific medical chatbots. © 2024 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LLAMA2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LLama2 is a large language model evaluated in the study for its performance in doctor-patient written communication in Turkish health counseling)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LLAMA3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LLama3 is a large language model evaluated in the study for its performance in doctor-patient written communication in Turkish health counseling)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISTRALBASED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mistralbased is a large language model evaluated in the study for its performance in doctor-patient written communication in Turkish health counseling)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMBALINGO-TURKISH-CHAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SambaLingo-Turkish-Chat is a model that performed well in terms of response accuracy and contextual relevance in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRENDYOL-LLM-7B-CHAT-V 1.8<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Trendyol-LLM-7b-chat-v 1.8 is a model that performed well in ethical aspects of doctor-patient communication in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IEEE is the organization that published the study in 2024)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURKISH HEALTHCARE SERVICES<|>GEO<|>Turkish healthcare services are the context in which the study evaluates the potential of AI-powered virtual doctor assistants)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AI-POWERED VIRTUAL DOCTOR ASSISTANTS<|>EVENT<|>AI-powered virtual doctor assistants are the focus of the study, demonstrating their potential in Turkish healthcare services)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLAMA2<|>TURKISH HEALTHCARE SERVICES<|>LLama2 was evaluated for its performance in Turkish healthcare services<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLAMA3<|>TURKISH HEALTHCARE SERVICES<|>LLama3 was evaluated for its performance in Turkish healthcare services<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MISTRALBASED<|>TURKISH HEALTHCARE SERVICES<|>Mistralbased was evaluated for its performance in Turkish healthcare services<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMBALINGO-TURKISH-CHAT<|>TURKISH HEALTHCARE SERVICES<|>SambaLingo-Turkish-Chat demonstrated success in Turkish healthcare services<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRENDYOL-LLM-7B-CHAT-V 1.8<|>TURKISH HEALTHCARE SERVICES<|>Trendyol-LLM-7b-chat-v 1.8 demonstrated success in ethical aspects of Turkish healthcare services<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AI-POWERED VIRTUAL DOCTOR ASSISTANTS<|>TURKISH HEALTHCARE SERVICES<|>AI-powered virtual doctor assistants are being developed for Turkish healthcare services<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IEEE<|>AI-POWERED VIRTUAL DOCTOR ASSISTANTS<|>IEEE published the study on AI-powered virtual doctor assistants<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
