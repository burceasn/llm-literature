This paper surveys the cutting-edge achievements in applying PLMs to various medical NLP tasks. Specifically, we first brief PLMS and outline the research of PLMs in medicine. Next, we categorise and discuss the types of tasks in medical NLP, covering text summarisation, question-answering, machine translation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, information extraction, medical education, relation extraction, and text mining. For each type of task, we first provide an overview of the basic concepts, the main methodologies, the advantages of applying PLMs, the basic steps of applying PLMs application, the datasets for training and testing, and the metrics for task evaluation. Subsequently, a summary of recent important research findings is presented, analysing their motivations, strengths vs weaknesses, similarities vs differences, and discussing potential limitations. Also, we assess the quality and influence of the research reviewed in this paper by comparing the citation count of the papers reviewed and the reputation and impact of the conferences and journals where they are published. Through these indicators, we further identify the most concerned research topics currently. Finally, we look forward to future research directions, including enhancing models’ reliability, explainability, and fairness, to promote the application of PLMs in clinical practice. In addition, this survey also collect some download links of some model codes and the relevant datasets, which are valuable references for researchers applying NLP techniques in medicine and medical professionals seeking to enhance their expertise and healthcare service through AI technology. © 2024 The Authors\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
