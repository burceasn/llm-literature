While previous studies have explored the capabilities of specific LLMs like ChatGPT in cardiac imaging, a comprehensive evaluation comparing multiple LLMs in the context of CAD-RADS 2.0 has been lacking. This study addresses this gap by assessing the performance of various LLMs, including ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 4o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Mistral Large, Meta Llama 3 70B, and Perplexity Pro, in answering 30 multiple-choice questions derived from the CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT 4o achieved the highest accuracy at 100 %, with ChatGPT 4 and Claude 3 Opus closely following at 96.6 %. Other models, including Mistral Large, Perplexity Pro, Meta Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, also demonstrated commendable performance, though with slightly lower accuracy ranging from 90 % to 93.3 %. This study underscores the proficiency of current LLMs in understanding and applying CAD-RADS 2.0, suggesting their potential to significantly enhance radiological reporting and patient care in coronary artery disease. The variations in model performance highlight the need for further research, particularly in evaluating the visual diagnostic capabilities of LLMsâ€”a critical component of radiology practice. This study provides a foundational comparison of LLMs in CAD-RADS 2.0 and sets the stage for future investigations into their broader applications in radiology, emphasizing the importance of integrating both text-based and visual knowledge for optimal clinical outcomes.
