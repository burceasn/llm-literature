Chatbots, serving as interactive conversational models, will probably drive this patient-centered transformation in healthcare. Through the provision of various services, including diagnosis, personalized lifestyle recommendations, dynamic scheduling of follow-ups, and mental health support, the objective is to substantially augment patient health outcomes, all the while mitigating the workload burden on healthcare providers. The life-critical nature of healthcare applications necessitates establishing a unified and comprehensive set of evaluation metrics for conversational models. Existing evaluation metrics proposed for various generic large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a lack of comprehension regarding medical and health concepts and their significance in promoting patients’ well-being. Moreover, these metrics neglect pivotal user-centered aspects, including trust-building, ethics, personalization, empathy, user comprehension, and emotional support. The purpose of this paper is to explore state-of-the-art LLM-based evaluation metrics that are specifically applicable to the assessment of interactive conversational models in healthcare. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics designed to thoroughly assess the performance of healthcare chatbots from an end-user perspective. These metrics encompass an evaluation of language processing abilities, impact on real-world clinical tasks, and effectiveness in user-interactive conversations. Finally, we engage in a discussion concerning the challenges associated with defining and implementing these metrics, with particular emphasis on confounding factors such as the target audience, evaluation methods, and prompt techniques involved in the evaluation process. © The Author(s) 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generative Artificial Intelligence is a technology set to revolutionize healthcare delivery by transforming traditional patient care into a more personalized, efficient, and proactive process)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATBOTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chatbots are interactive conversational models that will drive patient-centered transformation in healthcare by providing services like diagnosis, personalized lifestyle recommendations, and mental health support)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large Language Models are generic models that lack comprehension of medical and health concepts and neglect user-centered aspects like trust-building, ethics, and personalization)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCARE CHATBOTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Healthcare chatbots are interactive conversational models designed to improve patient health outcomes and reduce the workload burden on healthcare providers)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S) 2024<|>PERSON<|>The author(s) of the paper discussing state-of-the-art LLM-based evaluation metrics for healthcare chatbots)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>CHATBOTS<|>Generative Artificial Intelligence is driving the development of chatbots for healthcare transformation<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATBOTS<|>HEALTHCARE CHATBOTS<|>Chatbots are the foundation for healthcare chatbots, which are tailored for patient-centered care<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>HEALTHCARE CHATBOTS<|>Healthcare chatbots are built on large language models, but require specialized evaluation metrics for healthcare applications<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S) 2024<|>HEALTHCARE CHATBOTS<|>The author(s) propose evaluation metrics specifically designed for healthcare chatbots<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
