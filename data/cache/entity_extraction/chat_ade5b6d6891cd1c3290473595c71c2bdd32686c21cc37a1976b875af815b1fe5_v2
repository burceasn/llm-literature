This research is motivated by transformersâ€™ success in natural language processing tasks, and the opportunity to further improve performance for medical-domain specific tasks by exploiting models pre-trained on health data. We consider transfer learning involving fine-tuning of pre-trained models for predicting medical codes, formulated as a multi-label problem. We find that domain-specific transformers outperform state-of-the-art results for multi-label problems with the number of labels ranging from 18 to 158, for a fixed sequence length. Additionally, we find that, for longer documents and/or number of labels greater than 300, traditional neural networks still have an edge over transformers. These findings are obtained by performing extensive experiments on the semi-structured eICU data and the free-form MIMIC III data, and applying various transformers including BERT, RoBERTa, and Longformer variations. The electronic health record data used in this research exhibits a high level of label imbalance. Considering individual label accuracy, we find that for eICU data medical-domain specific RoBERTa models achieve improvements for more frequent labels. For infrequent labels, in both datasets, traditional neural networks still perform better.
