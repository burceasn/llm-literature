The performance of these tools have been evaluated thoroughly across medicine in diverse tasks, including standardized medical examinations, medical-decision making, and many others. In this journal, Anaya et al. published a study comparing the readability metrics of medical education resources formulated by ChatGPT with those of major U.S. institutions (AHA, ACC, HFSA) about heart failure. In this work, we provide a critical review of this article and further describe approaches to help mitigate challenges in reproducibility of studies evaluating LLMs in cardiology. Additionally, we provide suggestions to optimize sampling of responses provided by LLMs for future studies. Overall, while the study by Anaya et al. provides a meaningful contribution to literature of LLMs in cardiology, further comprehensive studies are necessary to address current limitations and further strengthen our understanding of these novel tools.
