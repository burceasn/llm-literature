However, as techniques continue to advance and become more complex, it is increasingly challenging for clinicians to stay abreast of the latest research. This overview aims to translate research concepts and potential concerns to healthcare professionals interested in applying AI and ML to resuscitation research but who are not experts in the field. Main text: We present various research including prediction models using structured and unstructured data, exploring treatment heterogeneity, reinforcement learning, language processing, and large-scale language models. These studies potentially offer valuable insights for optimizing treatment strategies and clinical workflows. However, implementing AI and ML in clinical settings presents its own set of challenges. The availability of high-quality and reliable data is crucial for developing accurate ML models. A rigorous validation process and the integration of ML into clinical practice is essential for practical implementation. We furthermore highlight the potential risks associated with self-fulfilling prophecies and feedback loops, emphasizing the importance of transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness in AI and ML models. These issues need to be addressed in order to establish reliable and trustworthy AI and ML models. Conclusion: In this article, we overview concepts and examples of AI and ML research in the resuscitation field. Moving forward, appropriate understanding of ML and collaboration with relevant experts will be essential for researchers and clinicians to overcome the challenges and harness the full potential of AI and ML in resuscitation. © 2023 The Author(s)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Artificial intelligence (AI) is an important area of computer science that has applications in medicine and resuscitation research, focusing on prediction models, treatment heterogeneity, and large-scale language models)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves developing models using structured and unstructured data, with applications in optimizing treatment strategies and clinical workflows)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESUSCITATION RESEARCH<|>EVENT<|>A field of study that applies AI and ML techniques to improve treatment strategies and clinical workflows in healthcare)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLINICIANS<|>PERSON<|>Healthcare professionals who aim to apply AI and ML in resuscitation research but face challenges in staying updated with the latest advancements)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCHERS<|>PERSON<|>Experts who collaborate with clinicians to develop and implement AI and ML models in resuscitation research)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, focusing on developing models for data analysis and prediction<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>RESUSCITATION RESEARCH<|>AI is applied in resuscitation research to improve treatment strategies and clinical workflows<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>RESUSCITATION RESEARCH<|>ML techniques are used in resuscitation research to develop prediction models and optimize clinical workflows<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINICIANS<|>RESUSCITATION RESEARCH<|>Clinicians aim to apply AI and ML in resuscitation research but face challenges in understanding complex techniques<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESEARCHERS<|>RESUSCITATION RESEARCH<|>Researchers collaborate with clinicians to develop and implement AI and ML models in resuscitation research<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINICIANS<|>RESEARCHERS<|>Clinicians and researchers collaborate to overcome challenges and harness the potential of AI and ML in resuscitation research<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
