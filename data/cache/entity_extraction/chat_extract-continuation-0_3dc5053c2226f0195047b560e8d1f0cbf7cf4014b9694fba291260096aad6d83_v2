This opens the door to large-scale projects that rely on variables that are not typically recorded in a structured form, such as patient signs and symptoms. Objectives: This study is designed to acquaint the emergency medicine research community with the foundational elements of NLP, highlighting essential terminology, annotation methodologies, and the intricacies involved in training and evaluating NLP models. Symptom characterization is critical to urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis, but identification of symptoms from the EHR has historically been challenging, limiting large-scale research, public health surveillance, and EHR-based clinical decision support. We therefore developed and compared two NLP models to identify UTI symptoms from unstructured emergency department (ED) notes. Methods: The study population consisted of patients aged ≥ 18 who presented to an ED in a northeastern U.S. health system between June 2013 and August 2021 and had a urinalysis performed. We annotated a random subset of 1250 ED clinician notes from these visits for a list of 17 UTI symptoms. We then developed two task-specific LLMs to perform the task of named entity recognition: a convolutional neural network-based model (SpaCy) and a transformer-based model designed to process longer documents (Clinical Longformer). Models were trained on 1000 notes and tested on a holdout set of 250 notes. We compared model performance (precision, recall, F1 measure) at identifying the presence or absence of UTI symptoms at the note level. Results: A total of 8135 entities were identified in 1250 notes; 83.6% of notes included at least one entity. Overall F1 measure for note-level symptom identification weighted by entity frequency was 0.84 for the SpaCy model and 0.88 for the Longformer model. F1 measure for identifying presence or absence of any UTI symptom in a clinical note was 0.96 (232/250 correctly classified) for the SpaCy model and 0.98 (240/250 correctly classified) for the Longformer model. Conclusions: The study demonstrated the utility of LLMs and transformer-based models in particular for extracting UTI symptoms from unstructured ED clinical notes; models were highly accurate for detecting the presence or absence of any UTI symptom on the note level, with variable performance for individual symptoms. © 2024 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural language processing (NLP) tools, including large language models (LLMs), are used for labeling and classifying unstructured text in medical care and research, such as electronic health record (EHR) notes.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large language models (LLMs) are advanced NLP tools with applications in medical care and research, particularly in extracting information from unstructured text like EHR notes.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electronic health records (EHR) are digital records of patient health information, often containing unstructured text that can be analyzed using NLP tools.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)<|>EVENT<|>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a medical condition whose diagnosis relies on identifying symptoms from unstructured EHR notes, a task historically challenging for large-scale research and clinical decision support.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The emergency department (ED) is a healthcare setting where patients present with acute conditions, and their clinical notes are used for research and diagnosis, such as identifying UTI symptoms.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPACY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SpaCy is a convolutional neural network-based NLP model used in the study to identify UTI symptoms from unstructured ED notes.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLINICAL LONGFORMER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Clinical Longformer is a transformer-based NLP model designed to process longer documents, used in the study to identify UTI symptoms from unstructured ED notes.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIETY FOR ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine is the organization that published the study on NLP models for UTI symptom identification.)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>Large language models (LLMs) are a subset of NLP tools used for advanced text analysis in medical research.<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR)<|>NLP tools are used to analyze and extract information from unstructured text in electronic health records (EHR).<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)<|>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR)<|>UTI symptoms are identified from unstructured text in electronic health records (EHR) using NLP tools.<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED)<|>URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)<|>The study analyzed ED clinical notes to identify UTI symptoms using NLP models.<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPACY<|>CLINICAL LONGFORMER<|>Both SpaCy and Clinical Longformer are NLP models developed and compared in the study for identifying UTI symptoms from ED notes.<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPACY<|>URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)<|>SpaCy was used to identify UTI symptoms from unstructured ED notes.<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINICAL LONGFORMER<|>URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)<|>Clinical Longformer was used to identify UTI symptoms from unstructured ED notes.<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOCIETY FOR ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE<|>URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)<|>The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine published the study on NLP models for UTI symptom identification.<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
