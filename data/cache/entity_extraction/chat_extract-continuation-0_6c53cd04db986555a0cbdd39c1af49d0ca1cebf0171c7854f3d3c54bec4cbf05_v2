Materials and Methods: Oversight fell under the VA Office of Research Development (VA ORD) and DOE headquarters. An Executive Committee and 2 senior scientific liaisons work with VA and DOE leadership to optimize efforts in the service of shared scientific goals. The program supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including creation of a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes. Cross-cutting methods including natural language processing, image processing, and reusable code were developed. Results: The 79.6 million dollar collaboration has supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes and launched over 10 collaborative scientific projects in health conditions highly prevalent in veterans. A ground-breaking analysis on the Summit and Andes supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) of the genetic underpinnings of over 2000 health conditions across 44 million genetic variants which resulted in the identification of 38 270 independent genetic variants associating with one or more health traits. Of these, over 2000 identified associations were unique to non-European ancestry. Cross-cutting methods have advanced state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) including large language natural language processing and a system biology study focused on opioid addiction awarded the 2018 Gordon Bell Prize for outstanding achievement in high-performance computing. The collaboration has completed work in prostate cancer, suicide prevention, and cardiovascular disease, and cross-cutting data science. Predictive models developed in these projects are being tested for application in clinical management. Discussion: Eight new projects were launched in 2023, taking advantage of the momentum generated by the previous collaboration. A major challenge has been limitations in the scope of appropriated funds at DOE which cannot currently be used for health research. Conclusion: Extensive multidisciplinary interactions take time to establish and are essential to continued progress. New funding models for maintaining high-performance computing infrastructure at the ORNL and for supporting continued collaboration by joint VA-DOE research teams are needed.  © 2024 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is a U.S. federal agency that provides healthcare services to veterans and established the MVP-CHAMPION research collaboration with the Department of Energy in 2016)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Department of Energy (DOE) is a U.S. federal agency responsible for energy policy and nuclear safety, and it partnered with the VA in the MVP-CHAMPION research collaboration)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VA OFFICE OF RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The VA Office of Research Development (VA ORD) oversees the MVP-CHAMPION research collaboration and works with DOE headquarters to optimize scientific efforts)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is a DOE research facility where the Summit and Andes supercomputers were used for groundbreaking genomic analysis in the MVP-CHAMPION collaboration)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MVP-CHAMPION<|>EVENT<|>The Million Veteran Program-Computational Health Analytics for Medical Precision to Improve Outcomes Now (MVP-CHAMPION) is a research collaboration between the VA and DOE established in 2016 to advance genomic analysis and health research)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUMMIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Summit is a supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory used for genomic analysis in the MVP-CHAMPION collaboration)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Andes is a supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory used for genomic analysis in the MVP-CHAMPION collaboration)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GORDON BELL PRIZE<|>EVENT<|>The Gordon Bell Prize is an award for outstanding achievement in high-performance computing, awarded in 2018 for a system biology study on opioid addiction conducted under the MVP-CHAMPION collaboration)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS<|>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY<|>The VA and DOE established the MVP-CHAMPION research collaboration in 2016 to advance genomic analysis and health research<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VA OFFICE OF RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT<|>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS<|>The VA ORD oversees the MVP-CHAMPION collaboration and works with the VA to optimize scientific efforts<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VA OFFICE OF RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT<|>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY<|>The VA ORD works with DOE headquarters to oversee the MVP-CHAMPION collaboration<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY<|>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY<|>ORNL is a DOE research facility where the Summit and Andes supercomputers are used for genomic analysis in the MVP-CHAMPION collaboration<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUMMIT<|>OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY<|>Summit is a supercomputer located at ORNL and used for genomic analysis in the MVP-CHAMPION collaboration<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDES<|>OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY<|>Andes is a supercomputer located at ORNL and used for genomic analysis in the MVP-CHAMPION collaboration<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MVP-CHAMPION<|>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS<|>The MVP-CHAMPION collaboration was established by the VA in 2016 to advance genomic analysis and health research<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MVP-CHAMPION<|>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY<|>The MVP-CHAMPION collaboration was established by the DOE in 2016 to advance genomic analysis and health research<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GORDON BELL PRIZE<|>MVP-CHAMPION<|>The Gordon Bell Prize was awarded in 2018 for a system biology study on opioid addiction conducted under the MVP-CHAMPION collaboration<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
