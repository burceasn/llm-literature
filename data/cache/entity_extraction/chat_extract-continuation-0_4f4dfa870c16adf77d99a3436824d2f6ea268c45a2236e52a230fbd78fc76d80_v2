These models exhibit the remarkable ability to provide proficient responses to free-text queries, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of professional medical knowledge. This comprehensive survey delves into the functionalities of existing LLMs designed for healthcare applications and elucidates the trajectory of their development, starting with traditional Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and then moving to the present state of LLMs in the healthcare sector. First, we explore the potential of LLMs to amplify the efficiency and effectiveness of diverse healthcare applications, particularly focusing on clinical language understanding tasks. These tasks encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from named entity recognition and relation extraction to natural language inference, multimodal medical applications, document classification, and question-answering. Additionally, we conduct an extensive comparison of the most recent state-of-the-art LLMs in the healthcare domain, while also assessing the utilization of various open-source LLMs and highlighting their significance in healthcare applications. Furthermore, we present the essential performance metrics employed to evaluate LLMs in the biomedical domain, shedding light on their effectiveness and limitations. Finally, we summarize the prominent challenges and constraints faced by large language models in the healthcare sector by offering a holistic perspective on their potential benefits and shortcomings. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the current landscape of LLMs in healthcare, addressing their role in transforming medical applications and the areas that warrant further research and development. © 2024 by the authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems designed to process and generate human-like text, particularly in the healthcare sector, where they enhance clinical language understanding tasks and other medical applications)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRETRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS (PLMs)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) are foundational models that preceded LLMs, serving as the basis for the development of more advanced language models in healthcare)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCARE SECTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The healthcare sector is the domain where LLMs are being deployed to improve efficiency and effectiveness in tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, and document classification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLINICAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING TASKS<|>EVENT<|>Clinical language understanding tasks are a set of activities in healthcare that involve processing and interpreting medical text, including named entity recognition, relation extraction, and natural language inference)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOMEDICAL DOMAIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The biomedical domain is the field of study and application where LLMs are evaluated using performance metrics to assess their effectiveness and limitations)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs)<|>HEALTHCARE SECTOR<|>LLMs are deployed in the healthcare sector to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in medical applications<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs)<|>PRETRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS (PLMs)<|>LLMs evolved from PLMs, building on their foundational capabilities to advance healthcare applications<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs)<|>CLINICAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING TASKS<|>LLMs are used to perform clinical language understanding tasks, such as named entity recognition and relation extraction<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs)<|>BIOMEDICAL DOMAIN<|>LLMs are evaluated in the biomedical domain using performance metrics to determine their effectiveness and limitations<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
