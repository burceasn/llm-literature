QG can be used in an adaptive intelligent tutoring system or a dialog system for improving question answering in various text generation tasks. Traditional QG has used syntactic rules with linguistic features to generate factoid questions. However, more recent research has proposed using pre-trained Transformer-based models for generating questions that are more aware of the answers. The goal of this study was to create a multilingual database (English and Spanish) of automatically generated sets of questions using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLMs) in particular for a culturally sensitive health intelligent tutoring system (ITS) for the Hispanic population. Several language models (LMs) including Chat GPT, valhalla/t5-based-e2e-qg, T5 (Small, Base, and Large), mrm8488/bert2bert-spanish-question-generation, mT5 (Small and Base), Flan-T5 (Small, Base and Large), BART (Base and Large) and mBART (Large) were chosen for our experiments that were given a prompt to produce a set of questions (3, 5, 7 or 10) using transcribed texts as the context. We observed that a text/transcript of at least 100 words was sufficient to generate 5–7 questions of reasonable quality. When models were prompted to produce 10 or more questions based on texts containing 100 words or less the meaningfulness, syntax and semantic soundness of outputs decreased notably. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
