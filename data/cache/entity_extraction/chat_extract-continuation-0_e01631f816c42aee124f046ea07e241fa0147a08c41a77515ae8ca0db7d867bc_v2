This study aimed to develop non-invasive AI tools to detect and quantify emotional responsiveness in ALS patients, providing objective insights. Improved understanding of emotional responses could enhance patient-provider communication, telemedicine effectiveness, and clinical trial outcome measures. Methods: In this preliminary exploratory study, fourteen patients with ALS had audio recordings performed during routine clinic visits while wearing a wireless pulse oximeter. Emotion-triggering questions related to symptom progression, breathing, mobility, feeding tube, and financial burden were randomly asked. The same questions were posed in separate psychiatric evaluations. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to analyze transcriptions, topic classifications, sentiment, and emotional states, combining pulse and speech data. AI-generated reports summarized the findings. Results: Pulse alterations consistent with emotional arousal were identified, with longer consultations and positive communication reducing pulse fluctuations. Financial concerns triggered the strongest emotional response, while discussions about breathing, mobility, and feeding tube increased anxiety. AI-generated reports prioritized patient concerns and streamlined documentation for providers. Conclusions: This study introduces a novel approach to linking pulse and speech analysis to evaluate emotional responses in ALS patients. AI and affective computing provide valuable insights into emotional responses and disease progression, with potential applications for other neurological disorders. This approach could augment clinical trial outcomes by offering a more comprehensive view of patient well-being. © 2024 The Author(s)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALS<|>EVENT<|>ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) is a neurological disorder affecting patients' ability to express emotions due to impairments in facial expression, speech, body language, and cognitive function)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AI TOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Non-invasive AI tools were developed to detect and quantify emotional responsiveness in ALS patients, providing objective insights into their emotional states)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NLP was used to analyze transcriptions, topic classifications, sentiment, and emotional states from audio recordings of ALS patients)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFFECTIVE COMPUTING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Affective computing was used to provide insights into emotional responses and disease progression in ALS patients)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>PERSON<|>The author(s) of the study published in 2024 introduced a novel approach to linking pulse and speech analysis for evaluating emotional responses in ALS patients)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AI TOOLS<|>ALS<|>AI tools were developed to detect and quantify emotional responsiveness in ALS patients<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>AI TOOLS<|>NLP was used in conjunction with AI tools to analyze emotional states in ALS patients<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFFECTIVE COMPUTING<|>AI TOOLS<|>Affective computing was used alongside AI tools to provide insights into emotional responses in ALS patients<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>AI TOOLS<|>The author(s) developed AI tools to evaluate emotional responses in ALS patients<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>ALS<|>The author(s) conducted a study to improve understanding of emotional responses in ALS patients<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
