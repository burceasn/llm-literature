This study is developed as part of the Cantemist program of the Plan of Advancement of Language Technologies (Plan TL). This work tries to contribute to the existing NER technologies that focus on Spanish health-related documents. This is a necessary task given the amount of research, regarding the health sector, that is written in Spanish and the benefits it could bring to the medical environment. In fact, since most NER techniques are developed for English, this research cannot be completely exploited. In this research, we explore different machine learning techniques such as CRF, a Bidirectional Long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to address the task of detecting tumor morphology mentions from clinical texts written in Spanish. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
