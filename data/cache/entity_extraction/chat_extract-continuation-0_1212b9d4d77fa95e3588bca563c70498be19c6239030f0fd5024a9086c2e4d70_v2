Methods: We collected information of evaluation tasks released in community challenges of biomedical text mining, including task description, dataset description, data source, task type and related links. A systematic summary and comparative analysis were conducted on various biomedical natural language processing tasks, such as named entity recognition, entity normalization, attribute extraction, relation extraction, event extraction, text classification, text similarity, knowledge graph construction, question answering, text generation, and large language model evaluation. Results: We identified 39 evaluation tasks from 6 community challenges that spanned from 2017 to 2023. Our analysis revealed the diverse range of evaluation task types and data sources in biomedical text mining. We explored the potential clinical applications of these community challenge tasks from a translational biomedical informatics perspective. We compared with their English counterparts, and discussed the contributions, limitations, lessons and guidelines of these community challenges, while highlighting future directions in the era of large language models. Conclusion: Community challenge evaluation competitions have played a crucial role in promoting technology innovation and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration in the field of biomedical text mining. These challenges provide valuable platforms for researchers to develop state-of-the-art solutions. © 2024 The Authors\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is the country where the study on biomedical text mining community challenges is focused, highlighting advancements and evaluation tasks in the field)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOMEDICAL TEXT MINING<|>EVENT<|>Biomedical text mining refers to the process of extracting meaningful information from biomedical texts, involving tasks like named entity recognition, relation extraction, and knowledge graph construction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMUNITY CHALLENGES<|>EVENT<|>Community challenges are evaluation competitions that promote technology innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration in biomedical text mining, providing platforms for researchers to develop advanced solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS<|>EVENT<|>Large language models are advanced AI systems evaluated in biomedical text mining tasks, contributing to tasks like text generation and question answering)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>BIOMEDICAL TEXT MINING<|>The study focuses on reviewing recent advances in biomedical text mining in China<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOMEDICAL TEXT MINING<|>COMMUNITY CHALLENGES<|>Community challenges are a key component of biomedical text mining, driving innovation and collaboration<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMUNITY CHALLENGES<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS<|>Community challenges evaluate the performance of large language models in biomedical text mining tasks<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
