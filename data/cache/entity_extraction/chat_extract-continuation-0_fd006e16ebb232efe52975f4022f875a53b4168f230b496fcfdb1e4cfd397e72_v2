Specifically, we introduce a rule-augmented AI-empowered system which incorporates a rule-based decision system, the ChatGPT application programming interface (API), and other external machine learning and analytical APIs to offer diagnostic suggestions to patients. The complexities of patient healthcare experiences, including doctor-patient interactions, understanding levels, treatment procedures, and preventive care, are considered. We illustrate how a diagnostic process typically integrates various strategies depending on various factors. To digitize the greatest portion of the process, we propose and illustrate the use of LLMs for humanizing the communication process and investigating ways to reduce burdens and costs in primary healthcare. We also outline a theoretical decision model for evaluating the use of technological components from external sources versus building them from scratch. The paper is structured into sections detailing background theories and context, our proposed and implemented rule-augmented AI-empowered system, as well as a system test in a corresponding use case. Finally, the paper key findings are presented, which contribute valuable insights for future work in this field. © 2023 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to technologies that enhance healthcare and medical literature understanding through Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)>)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI technologies used to improve communication and reduce burdens in healthcare processes>)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a technology used to enhance the understanding of medical literature and patient interactions>)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT API<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ChatGPT API is a tool integrated into a rule-augmented AI-empowered system to provide diagnostic suggestions to patients>)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IEEE is the organization that published the paper on AI technologies in healthcare>)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>AI technologies incorporate LLMs to enhance healthcare processes<|>8>)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>AI technologies use NLP to improve medical literature understanding<|>8>)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT API<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>The ChatGPT API is part of an AI-empowered system for healthcare diagnostics<|>7>)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IEEE<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>IEEE published a paper on AI technologies in healthcare<|>6>)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
