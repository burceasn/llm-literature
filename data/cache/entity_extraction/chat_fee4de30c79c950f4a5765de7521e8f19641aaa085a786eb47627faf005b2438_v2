Furthermore, the vast amount of unlabeled data associated with chemical compounds or molecules has emerged as a crucial research focus, prompting the need for CLMs with reasoning capabilities over such data. Molecular graphs and molecular descriptors are the predominant approaches to representing molecules for property prediction in machine learning (ML). However, Transformer-based LMs have recently emerged as de-facto powerful tools in deep learning (DL), showcasing outstanding performance across various NLP downstream tasks, particularly in text analysis. Within the realm of pre-trained transformer-based LMs such as, BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants) have been extensively explored in the chemical informatics domain. Various learning tasks in cheminformatics such as the text analysis that necessitate handling of chemical SMILES data which contains intricate relations among elements or atoms, have become increasingly prevalent. Whether the objective is predicting molecular reactions or molecular property prediction, there is a growing demand for LMs capable of learning molecular contextual information within SMILES sequences or strings from text inputs (i.e., SMILES). This review provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art of chemical language Transformer-based LMs in chemical informatics for de novo design, and analyses current limitations, challenges, and advantages. Finally, a perspective on future opportunities is provided in this evolving field. © 2024 The Authors\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
