Transformer is a type of deep learning architecture initially developed to solve general-purpose Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and has subsequently been adapted in many fields, including healthcare. In this survey paper, we provide an overview of how this architecture has been adopted to analyze various forms of healthcare data, including clinical NLP, medical imaging, structured Electronic Health Records (EHR), social media, bio-physiological signals, biomolecular sequences. Furthermore, which have also include the articles that used the transformer architecture for generating surgical instructions and predicting adverse outcomes after surgeries under the umbrella of critical care. Under diverse settings, these models have been used for clinical diagnosis, report generation, data reconstruction, and drug/protein synthesis. Finally, we also discuss the benefits and limitations of using transformers in healthcare and examine issues such as computational cost, model interpretability, fairness, alignment with human values, ethical implications, and environmental impact. © 2024 The Authors\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
