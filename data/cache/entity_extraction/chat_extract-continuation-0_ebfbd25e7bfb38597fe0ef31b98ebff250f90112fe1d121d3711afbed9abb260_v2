Despite substantial technological advancements for battling cancer, early diagnosis and selection of effective treatment remains a challenge. With the convenience of large-scale datasets including multiple levels of data, new bioinformatic tools are needed to transform this wealth of information into clinically useful decision-support tools. In this field, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with their highly diverse applications are rapidly gaining ground. Machine learning methods, such as Bayesian networks, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and K-nearest neighbors, including neural network models like deep learning, have proven valuable in predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic studies. Researchers have recently employed large language models to tackle new dimensions of problems. However, leveraging the opportunity to utilize AI in clinical settings will require surpassing significant obstacles—a major issue is the lack of use of the available reporting guidelines obstructing the reproducibility of published studies. In this review, we discuss the applications of AI methods and explore their benefits and limitations. We summarize the available guidelines for AI in healthcare and highlight the potential role and impact of AI models on future directions in cancer research. © The Author(s) 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CANCER<|>EVENT<|>Cancer is a heterogeneous and multifaceted disease with a significant global footprint, posing challenges in early diagnosis and treatment selection)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI technologies are rapidly gaining ground in cancer research, with applications in predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic studies)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Machine learning methods, including Bayesian networks, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, K-nearest neighbors, and neural network models, are valuable tools in cancer research)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large language models are being employed to tackle new dimensions of problems in cancer research)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHOR(S) 2024<|>PERSON<|>The authors of the review discussing the applications, benefits, and limitations of AI methods in cancer research)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>AI technologies are being applied to address challenges in cancer diagnosis and treatment<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>Machine learning methods are used to improve predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic capabilities in cancer research<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>Machine learning is a subset of AI technologies applied in cancer research<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS<|>Large language models are a type of AI technology being used in cancer research<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR(S) 2024<|>CANCER<|>The authors discuss the role of AI in addressing challenges in cancer research<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR(S) 2024<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>The authors explore the applications, benefits, and limitations of AI in cancer research<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
