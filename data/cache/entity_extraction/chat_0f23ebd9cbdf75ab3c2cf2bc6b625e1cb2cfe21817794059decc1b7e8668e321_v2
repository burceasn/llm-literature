Modern machine learning (ML) architectures enable the program to answer almost any question, to summarize, translate, and even generate its own texts, all in a text-based dialogue with the user. Underlying technologies, summarized under the acronym NLP (natural language processing), go back to the 1960s. In almost all areas including medicine, ChatGPT is raising enormous hopes. It can easily pass medical exams and may be useful in patient care, diagnostic and therapeutic assistance, and medical research. The enthusiasm for this new technology shown even by medical professionals is surprising. Although the system knows much, it does not know everything; not everything it outputs is accurate either. Every output has to be carefully checked by the user for correctness, which is often not easily done since references to sources are lacking. Issues regarding data protection and ethics also arise. Today’s language models are not free of bias and systematic distortion. These shortcomings have led to calls for stronger regulation of the use of ChatGPT and an increasing number of similar language models. However, this new technology represents an enormous progress in knowledge processing and dissemination. Numerous scenarios in which ChatGPT can provide assistance are conceivable, including in rhythmology. In the future, it will be crucial to render the models error-free and transparent and to clearly define the rules for their use. Responsible use requires systematic training to improve the digital competence of users, including physicians who use such programs. © 2023, The Author(s).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
