Online psychological counselling emerged as the predominant mode of providing services in response to this demand. In this study, we propose the Psy-LLM framework, an AI-based assistive tool leveraging large language models (LLMs) for question answering in psychological consultation settings to ease the demand on mental health professions. Our framework combines pre-trained LLMs with real-world professional questions-and-answers (Q&A) from psychologists and extensively crawled psychological articles. The Psy-LLM framework serves as a front-end tool for healthcare professionals, allowing them to provide immediate responses and mindfulness activities to alleviate patient stress. Additionally, it functions as a screening tool to identify urgent cases requiring further assistance. We evaluated the framework using intrinsic metrics, such as perplexity, and extrinsic evaluation metrics, including human participant assessments of response helpfulness, fluency, relevance, and logic. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psy-LLM framework in generating coherent and relevant answers to psychological questions. This article discusses the potential and limitations of using large language models to enhance mental health support through AI technologies. © 2023 by the authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PSY-LLM FRAMEWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An AI-based assistive tool leveraging large language models (LLMs) for question answering in psychological consultation settings, designed to ease the demand on mental health professionals by providing immediate responses and mindfulness activities to alleviate patient stress and identifying urgent cases requiring further assistance)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>A global outbreak that heightened the need for timely and professional mental health support, significantly increasing the demand for psychological counselling)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELLING<|>EVENT<|>A service that has grown significantly in demand, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with online psychological counselling emerging as the predominant mode of providing services)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PSY-LLM FRAMEWORK<|>COVID-19<|>The Psy-LLM framework was developed in response to the increased demand for mental health support caused by the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PSY-LLM FRAMEWORK<|>PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELLING<|>The Psy-LLM framework is designed to support psychological counselling by providing AI-based assistance to mental health professionals<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
