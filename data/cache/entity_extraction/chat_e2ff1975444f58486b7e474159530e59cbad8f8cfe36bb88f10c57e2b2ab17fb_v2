Such impairments are often exhibited in patients' conversations. Researches have shown that assessments of thought disorder are crucial for tracking the clinical patients' conditions and early detection of clinical high-risks. Detecting such symptoms require a trained clinician's expertise, which is prohibitive due to cost and the high patient-to-clinician ratio. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method using Transformer-based model to help automate the assessment of the severity of the thought disorder of schizophrenia. The proposed model uses both textual and acoustic speech between occupational therapists or psychiatric nurses and schizophrenia patients to predict the level of their thought disorder. Experimental results show that the proposed model has the ability to closely predict the results of assessments for Schizophrenia patients base on the extracted semantic, syntactic and acoustic features. Thus, we believe our model can be a helpful tool to doctors when they are assessing schizophrenia patients.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
