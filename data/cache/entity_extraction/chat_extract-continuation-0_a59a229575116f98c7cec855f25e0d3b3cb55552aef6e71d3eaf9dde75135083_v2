AI uses a variety of approaches and techniques, such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing and formal logic, among others. Rather than counting the exact amount of AI, it is more relevant to talk about specific advances and applications. AI has the potential to provide a number of significant benefits in the field of assistive medicine. Despite these benefits, the implementation of AI in medicine also raises ethical and privacy challenges that need to be carefully addressed. ChatGPT remains the leading generative AI tool. People may inherit AI biases (systematic errors in AI results) in their decisions. 5P medicine represents a new trend in medicine today and involves a new approach to medical care, putting the patient at the center of a process that includes healing, prevention, prediction, individualization of therapies, and significant improvement in quality of life. © 2024 Permanyer Publications.
