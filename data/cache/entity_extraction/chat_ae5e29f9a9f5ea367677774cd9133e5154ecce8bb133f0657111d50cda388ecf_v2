These health records are currently coded manually or semi-automated to assign clinical codes (ICD-codes) for clinical research and analytics. This process is very time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. This paper presents a method for automated clinical coding of electronic health records (EHRs) given the patient diagnosis summary and other medical-related documents. The presented method uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which capture knowledge from the free-text diagnosis descriptions, do the text matching and semantic mapping, and translate diagnosis descriptions into clinical codes. We develop one baseline Word2vec and cosine similarity hybrid model, a transformer encoder model, and a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for the automated clinical coding. The presented models are evaluated using a publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset. The used dataset consists of various patient diagnosis descriptions and corresponding ICD-9 codes. The experimental results show that the presented BlueBERT based automated clinical coding model produced an AUC (area under ROC curve) value of 98.9% for the top-10 ICD codes prediction. On the full MIMIC-III dataset, the transformer model produced an accuracy of 76.8%, a precision of 61.02%, a recall of 47.22%, a f1-score of 53.2%, and an AUC value of 92.1%. The hybrid baseline model and another used transformer encoder model also showed promising results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
