Methods: To provide accurate and specialized medical responses, we integrated several cancer practice guidelines. The size of the integrated meta-dataset was 1.17 million tokens. The integrated and classified metadata were extracted, transformed into text, segmented to specific character lengths, and vectorized using the embedding model. The AI-guide bot was implemented using Python 3.9. To enhance the scalability and incorporate the integrated dataset, we combined the AI-guide bot with OpenAI and the LangChain framework. To generate user-friendly conversations, a language model was developed based on Chat-Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT), an interactive conversational chatbot powered by GPT-3.5. The AI-guide bot was implemented using ChatGPT3.5 from Sep. 2023 to Jan. 2024. Results: The AI-guide bot allowed users to select their desired cancer type and language for conversational interactions. The AI-guided bot was designed to expand its capabilities to encompass multiple major cancer types. The performance of the AI-guide bot responses was 90.98 ± 4.02 (obtained by summing up the Likert scores). Conclusions: The AI-guide bot can provide medical information quickly and accurately to patients with cancer who are concerned about their health. © 2024\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AI-GUIDE BOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A healthcare chatbot service developed to provide accurate health information to patients using large language models and integrated cancer practice guidelines.
