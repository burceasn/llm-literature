It has evolved from a concept to a technology that is driving innovation, transforming productivity and disrupting existing business models across numerous sectors. The industrial and societal impact of AI is profound and multifaceted, offering opportunities for growth, efficiency, and improved healthcare, but also raising ethical and societal challenges as the method is integrated into many aspects of human life and work. This editorial is developed by contributors of the 4th Royal Society Yusef Hamied Workshop ( in 2023 devoted to Artificial Intelligence), designed to enhance collaboration between Indian and the UK scientists and to explore future research opportunities.
