On the other hand, the use of these systems has significantly increased cyber threats in the healthcare sector. Vulnerabilities in the existing and legacy systems are one of the key causes for the threats and related risks. Understanding and addressing the threats from the connected medical devices and other parts of the ICT health infrastructure are of paramount importance for ensuring security within the overall healthcare ecosystem. Threat and vulnerability analysis provides an effective way to lower the impact of risks relating to the existing vulnerabilities. However, this is a challenging task due to the availability of massive data which makes it difficult to identify potential patterns of security issues. This paper contributes towards an effective threats and vulnerabilities analysis by adopting Machine Learning models, such as the BERT neural language model and XGBoost, to extract updated information from the Natural Language documents largely available on the web, evaluating at the same time the level of the identified threats and vulnerabilities that can impact on the healthcare system, providing the required information for the most appropriate management of the risk. Experiments were performed based on CS news extracted from the Hacker News website and on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability reports. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which provides a realistic manner to assess the threats and vulnerabilities from Natural Language texts, allowing adopting it in real-world Healthcare ecosystems. © 2023 by the authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electronic Health Records are widely adopted systems in healthcare for efficient service delivery and management)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HACKER NEWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hacker News is a website from which CS news was extracted for experiments in the study)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>COMMON VULNERABILITIES AND EXPOSURES (CVE)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CVE is a system that provides vulnerability reports used in the study)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a neural language model used in the study for threat and vulnerability analysis)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>XGBOOST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>XGBoost is a Machine Learning model used in the study for threat and vulnerability analysis)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCARE SECTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The healthcare sector is the industry impacted by cyber threats and vulnerabilities due to digitization)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Machine Learning is a field of study applied in the research to analyze threats and vulnerabilities in healthcare systems)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE DOCUMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural Language documents are sources of information used in the study for threat and vulnerability analysis)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCARE ECOSYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The healthcare ecosystem refers to the interconnected systems and devices in healthcare that face cyber threats)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS<|>HEALTHCARE SECTOR<|>Electronic Health Records are widely adopted in the healthcare sector for efficient service delivery<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HACKER NEWS<|>COMMON VULNERABILITIES AND EXPOSURES (CVE)<|>Both Hacker News and CVE reports were used as data sources in the study<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>XGBOOST<|>BERT and XGBoost are Machine Learning models used together in the study for threat and vulnerability analysis<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>HEALTHCARE ECOSYSTEM<|>Machine Learning models were applied to analyze threats and vulnerabilities in the healthcare ecosystem<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE DOCUMENTS<|>HEALTHCARE ECOSYSTEM<|>Natural Language documents were used to assess threats and vulnerabilities in the healthcare ecosystem<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTHCARE SECTOR<|>HEALTHCARE ECOSYSTEM<|>The healthcare sector is part of the broader healthcare ecosystem facing cyber threats<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
