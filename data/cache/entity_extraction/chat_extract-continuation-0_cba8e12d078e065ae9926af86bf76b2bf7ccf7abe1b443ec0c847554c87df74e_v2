Manual creation of patient summary is repetitive, time-consuming, prone to errors, and increases cliniciansâ€™ workload. AI, through voice recognition and Natural Language Processing (NLP), can automate this task more accurately and efficiently. Erectile dysfunction (ED) clinics, which deal with specific pattern of conditions together with an involvement of broader systemic issues, can greatly benefit from AI-driven patient summary. This scoping review examined the evidence on AI-generated patient summary and evaluated their implementation in ED clinics. Recent Findings: A total of 381 articles were initially identified, 11 studies were included for the analysis. These studies showcased various methodologies, such as AI-assisted clinical notes and NLP algorithms. Most studies have demonstrated the ability of AI to be used in real life clinical scenarios. Major electronic health record platforms are also integrating AI to their system. However, to date, no studies have specifically addressed AI for patient summary creation in ED clinics.
