With the rise of social media, adults often share their daily experiences, potentially revealing their emotional state on social platforms, like X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook. In this study, we present Ensemble (E) of Convolutional Neural Network (C), Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (L) Network, and Support Vector Machine (S) (E-CLS), utilizing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors, Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) word embeddings. This model effectively identifies depressive posts. Validated with a Twitter-derived depressive dataset, E-CLS achieves an impressive F1-score of 0.91, surpassing existing machine-learning and deep-learning models by 2%. This research advances the detection of depression in social media posts, holding promise for enhanced mental health monitoring. Furthermore, our work contributes to the burgeoning field of mental health informatics by leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing. The ensemble approach synergizes the strengths of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for local pattern recognition, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network for sequential context understanding, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for robust classification. The incorporation of TF-IDF vectors and GloVe embeddings enriches feature representation, enhancing the model’s ability to discern nuanced linguistic cues associated with depression. By demonstrating superior performance over established models, E-CLS showcases its potential as a valuable tool in digital mental health interventions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>X (FORMERLY TWITTER)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A social media platform where adults share their daily experiences and emotional states, formerly known as Twitter)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A social media platform where adults share their daily experiences and emotional states)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENSEMBLE (E)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A model combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for detecting depressive posts on social media)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A deep learning model used for local pattern recognition in the Ensemble (E) model)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A deep learning model used for sequential context understanding in the Ensemble (E) model)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A machine learning model used for robust classification in the Ensemble (E) model)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA, LLC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The publisher of the research under exclusive licence, part of Springer Nature 2024)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The parent organization of Springer Science+Business Media, LLC)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E-CLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ensemble model combining CNN, LSTM, and SVM, achieving an F1-score of 0.91 for detecting depressive posts)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWITTER-DERIVED DEPRESSIVE DATASET<|>EVENT<|>A dataset derived from Twitter used to validate the E-CLS model)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>X (FORMERLY TWITTER)<|>FACEBOOK<|>Both are social media platforms where adults share their daily experiences and emotional states<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENSEMBLE (E)<|>CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN)<|>CNN is a component of the Ensemble (E) model for local pattern recognition<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENSEMBLE (E)<|>LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) NETWORK<|>LSTM is a component of the Ensemble (E) model for sequential context understanding<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENSEMBLE (E)<|>SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)<|>SVM is a component of the Ensemble (E) model for robust classification<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E-CLS<|>TWITTER-DERIVED DEPRESSIVE DATASET<|>The E-CLS model was validated using the Twitter-derived depressive dataset<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA, LLC<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>Springer Science+Business Media, LLC is part of Springer Nature<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
