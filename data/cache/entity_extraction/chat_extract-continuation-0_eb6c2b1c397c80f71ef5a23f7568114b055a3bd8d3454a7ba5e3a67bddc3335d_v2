In recent years, the scientific community has shown interest in developing AOPs through crowdsourcing, with the results archived in the AOP-Wiki: a centralized repository coordinated by the OECD, hosting nearly 512 AOPs (April, 2023). However, the AOP-Wiki platform currently lacks a versatile querying system, which hinders developers' exploration of the AOP network and impedes its practical use in risk assessment. This work proposes to unleash the full potential of the AOP-Wiki archive by adapting its data into a Labelled Property Graph (LPG) schema. Additionally, the tool offers a visual network query interface for both database-specific and natural language queries, facilitating the retrieval and analysis of graph data. The multi-query interface allows non-technical users to construct flexible queries, thereby enhancing the potential for AOP exploration. By reducing the time and technical requirements, the present query engine enhances the practical utilization of the valuable data within AOP-Wiki. To evaluate the platform, a case study is presented with three levels of use-case scenarios (simple, moderate, and complex queries). AOPWIKI-EXPLORER is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/Crispae/AOPWiki_Explorer) for wider community reach and further enhancement.
