Compared to other languages, this mission with Arabic is relatively restricted and in its early stages, and this combination in the medical application area is rare. This paper builds an Arabic health care assistant, specifically a pediatrician that supports Arabic dialects, especially Egyptian accents. The proposed application is a chatbot based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) models after experimenting with Two Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models, a pre-trained BERT and Logistic regression TF-IDF and Doc2vec. These models were applied to the Arabic dataset with different dialects from different couturiers such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. The proposed system consists of 4 stages: scrapping and collecting data, then wrangling it, data preprocessing, data extraction, trained models with new data, and connect the model to the database that contains the answers. Experimental tests showed that the BERT model outperformed the others by getting a 95% Accuracy. Logistic regression with Doc2vec was the second best with 71% F-measure and 73% Accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARABIC HEALTH CARE ASSISTANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An AI-based chatbot designed to support Arabic dialects, especially Egyptian accents, in the healthcare domain, specifically for pediatric care)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, a pre-trained AI model used in the Arabic health care assistant project)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGISTIC REGRESSION TF-IDF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A machine learning model used in the Arabic health care assistant project for text classification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOC2VEC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A machine learning model used in the Arabic health care assistant project for text classification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGYPT<|>GEO<|>A country whose Arabic dialect was supported by the Arabic health care assistant)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUDI ARABIA<|>GEO<|>A country whose Arabic dialect was supported by the Arabic health care assistant)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IRAQ<|>GEO<|>A country whose Arabic dialect was supported by the Arabic health care assistant)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization that published the paper describing the Arabic health care assistant project)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARABIC HEALTH CARE ASSISTANT<|>BERT<|>The Arabic health care assistant uses the BERT model for text classification<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARABIC HEALTH CARE ASSISTANT<|>LOGISTIC REGRESSION TF-IDF<|>The Arabic health care assistant uses Logistic Regression TF-IDF for text classification<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARABIC HEALTH CARE ASSISTANT<|>DOC2VEC<|>The Arabic health care assistant uses Doc2vec for text classification<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARABIC HEALTH CARE ASSISTANT<|>EGYPT<|>The Arabic health care assistant supports the Egyptian dialect<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARABIC HEALTH CARE ASSISTANT<|>SAUDI ARABIA<|>The Arabic health care assistant supports the Saudi Arabian dialect<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARABIC HEALTH CARE ASSISTANT<|>IRAQ<|>The Arabic health care assistant supports the Iraqi dialect<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARABIC HEALTH CARE ASSISTANT<|>IEEE<|>The Arabic health care assistant project was published by IEEE<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
