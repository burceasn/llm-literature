Manual extraction of such outcomes from unstructured electronic health records is a slow, resource-intensive process. Natural language processing (NLP) methods can accelerate outcome annotation, but they require substantial labeled data. Transfer learning based on language modeling, particularly using the Transformer architecture, has achieved improvements in NLP performance. However, there has been no systematic evaluation of NLP model training strategies on the extraction of cancer outcomes from unstructured text. Results: We evaluated the performance of nine NLP models at the two tasks of identifying cancer response and cancer progression within imaging reports at a single academic center among patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We trained the classification models under different conditions, including training sample size, classification architecture, and language model pre-training. The training involved a labeled dataset of 14,218 imaging reports for 1112 patients with lung cancer. A subset of models was based on a pre-trained language model, DFCI-ImagingBERT, created by further pre-training a BERT-based model using an unlabeled dataset of 662,579 reports from 27,483 patients with cancer from our center. A classifier based on our DFCI-ImagingBERT, trained on more than 200 patients, achieved the best results in most experiments; however, these results were marginally better than simpler “bag of words” or convolutional neural network models. Conclusion: When developing AI models to extract outcomes from imaging reports for clinical cancer research, if computational resources are plentiful but labeled training data are limited, large language models can be used for zero- or few-shot learning to achieve reasonable performance. When computational resources are more limited but labeled training data are readily available, even simple machine learning architectures can achieve good performance for such tasks. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIO MED CENTRAL LTD.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BioMed Central Ltd. is a publisher of scientific research articles, including the study on NLP models for cancer outcome extraction)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature is a global publisher that includes BioMed Central Ltd. as part of its organization)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DFCI-IMAGINGBERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DFCI-ImagingBERT is a pre-trained language model developed for extracting cancer outcomes from imaging reports)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER<|>EVENT<|>Non-small cell lung cancer is a type of cancer for which imaging reports were analyzed in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE<|>EVENT<|>The Transformer architecture is a machine learning framework used in NLP models for tasks like cancer outcome extraction)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NLP MODELS<|>EVENT<|>NLP models are machine learning tools evaluated for extracting cancer outcomes from unstructured imaging reports)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIO MED CENTRAL LTD.<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>BioMed Central Ltd. is part of Springer Nature<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DFCI-IMAGINGBERT<|>NLP MODELS<|>DFCI-ImagingBERT is a pre-trained language model used in NLP models for cancer outcome extraction<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NLP MODELS<|>NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER<|>NLP models were used to analyze imaging reports of patients with non-small cell lung cancer<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE<|>NLP MODELS<|>The Transformer architecture is the foundation for some of the NLP models evaluated in the study<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
