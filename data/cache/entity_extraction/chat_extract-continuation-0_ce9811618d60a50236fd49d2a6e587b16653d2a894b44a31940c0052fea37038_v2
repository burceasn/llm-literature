Rooted in the advancements of machine learning models, AI has spawned various transformative technologies such as deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. This technological evolution is poised to witness a broadened spectrum of applications across diverse domains, with a particular focus on revolutionizing healthcare services. Noteworthy among these innovations is OpenAI's creation, ChatGPT, which stands out for its profound capabilities in intricate analysis, primarily facilitated through extensive language modeling. In the realm of healthcare, AI applications, including ChatGPT, have showcased promising outcomes, especially in the domain of neonatal nursing. Areas such as pain assessment, feeding processes, and patient status determination have witnessed substantial enhancements through the integration of AI technologies. However, it is crucial to approach the deployment of such applications with a judicious mindset. The accuracy of the underlying data must undergo rigorous validation, and any results lacking a solid foundation in scientific insights should be approached with skepticism. The paramount consideration remains patient safety, necessitating that AI applications, like ChatGPT, undergo thorough scrutiny through controlled and evidence-based studies. Only through such meticulous evaluation can the transformative potential of AI be harnessed responsibly, ensuring its alignment with the highest standards of healthcare practice.  © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
