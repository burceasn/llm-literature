ChatGPT utilizes natural language processing based on a ”generative pre-trained transfer” (GPT) model, specifically the transformer architecture, to generate human-like responses to a wide range of questions and topics. Equipped with approximately 57 billion words and 175 billion parameters from online data, ChatGPT has potential applications in medicine and orthopedics. One of its key strengths is its personalized, easy-to-understand, and adaptive response, which allows it to learn continuously through user interaction. This article discusses how AI, especially ChatGPT, presents numerous opportunities in orthopedics, ranging from preoperative planning and surgical techniques to patient education and medical support. Although ChatGPT’s user-friendly responses and adaptive capabilities are laudable, its limitations, including biased responses and ethical concerns, necessitate its cautious and responsible use. Surgeons and healthcare providers should leverage the strengths of the ChatGPT while recognizing its current limitations and verifying critical information through in-dependent research and expert opinions. As AI technology continues to evolve, ChatGPT may become a valuable tool in orthopedic education and patient care, leading to improved outcomes and efficiency in healthcare delivery. The integration of AI into orthopedics offers substantial benefits but requires careful consideration and continuous improvement. © 2024 by The Korean Orthopaedic Association.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
