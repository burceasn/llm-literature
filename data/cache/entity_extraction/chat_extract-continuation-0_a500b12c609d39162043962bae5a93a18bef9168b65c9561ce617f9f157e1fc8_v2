This research delves into the intricacies of chatbot technology, from its foundational concepts to advanced generative models like ChatGPT. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of existing chatbot approaches, distinguishing between rule-based, retrieval-based, generative, and hybrid models. A specific emphasis is placed on ChatGPT, elucidating its merits for frequently asked questions (FAQs)-based chatbots, coupled with an exploration of associated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as named entity recognition, intent classification, and sentiment analysis. The paper further delves into the customization and fine-tuning of ChatGPT, its integration with knowledge bases, and the consequent challenges and ethical considerations that arise. Through real-world applications in domains such as online shopping, healthcare, and education, we underscore the transformative potential of chatbots. However, we also spotlight open challenges and suggest future research directions, emphasizing the need for optimizing conversational flow, advancing dialogue mechanics, improving domain adaptability, and enhancing ethical considerations. The research culminates in a call for further exploration in ensuring transparent, ethical, and user-centric chatbot systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is an advanced generative model used in chatbot technology, known for its applications in FAQs-based chatbots and integration with NLP techniques like named entity recognition, intent classification, and sentiment analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELSEVIER LTD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Elsevier Ltd is the publisher of the research paper discussing chatbot technology and its applications)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>EVENT<|>NLP refers to the techniques used in chatbot technology, including named entity recognition, intent classification, and sentiment analysis)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ChatGPT utilizes NLP techniques such as named entity recognition, intent classification, and sentiment analysis<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ELSEVIER LTD<|>Elsevier Ltd published research discussing ChatGPT and its applications<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
