These tasks are particularly helpful in vascular surgery, where the clinical and administrative burden is high due to the rising incidence of vascular disease, the medical complexity of the patients, and the potential for innovation and care advancement. The rapid development of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques have facilitated the training of large language models, such as GPT-4 (OpenAI), which can support the development of increasingly powerful virtual assistants. These tools may support holistic, multidisciplinary, and high-quality vascular care delivery throughout the pre-, intra-, and postoperative stages. Importantly, it is critical to consider the design, safety, and challenges related to virtual assistants, including data security, ethical, and equity concerns. By combining the perspectives of patients, clinicians, data scientists, and other stakeholders when developing, implementing, and monitoring virtual assistants, there is potential to harness the power of this technology to care for vascular surgery patients more effectively. In this comprehensive review article, we introduce the concept of virtual assistants, describe potential applications of virtual assistants in vascular surgery for clinicians and patients, highlight the benefits and drawbacks of large language models, such as GPT-4, and discuss considerations around the design, safety, and challenges associated with virtual assistants in vascular surgery. © 2024 The Author(s)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Digital services designed to simulate human conversation and provide personalized responses, particularly useful in healthcare and vascular surgery for diagnosing, managing disease, and supporting medical research and education)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT-4<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A large language model developed by OpenAI, used to support the development of powerful virtual assistants in healthcare and vascular surgery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization behind the development of GPT-4, a large language model used in virtual assistants for healthcare applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VASCULAR SURGERY<|>EVENT<|>A medical field where virtual assistants are being utilized to improve care delivery, particularly due to the high clinical and administrative burden associated with vascular disease)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>EVENT<|>A rapidly developing field that facilitates the training of large language models like GPT-4, enabling the creation of advanced virtual assistants for healthcare)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>EVENT<|>A subset of artificial intelligence that supports the development of virtual assistants by enabling them to learn from data and improve over time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>EVENT<|>A technique used in artificial intelligence to enable virtual assistants to understand and respond to human language, particularly in healthcare applications)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS<|>GPT-4<|>GPT-4 is a large language model that supports the development of virtual assistants for healthcare applications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-4<|>OPENAI<|>GPT-4 is developed by OpenAI, an organization specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS<|>VASCULAR SURGERY<|>Virtual assistants are being used to improve care delivery in vascular surgery by supporting clinicians and patients<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables the development of advanced virtual assistants<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS<|>Natural language processing is a key technique used in virtual assistants to understand and respond to human language<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>Artificial intelligence facilitates the development of virtual assistants by enabling them to simulate human conversation and provide personalized responses<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
