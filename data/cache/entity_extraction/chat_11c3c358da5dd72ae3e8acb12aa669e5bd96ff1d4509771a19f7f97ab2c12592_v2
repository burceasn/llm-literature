This paper presents an innovative system that leverages modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities to extract information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and generate simplified patient summaries (SPS). These SPS are subsequently used to provide clinicians with summaries of relevant academic literature, improving their ability to access pertinent information efficiently. The system architecture employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate SPSs and summarize relevant information, while dense vector retriever models are used for information retrieval from document corpus, which is created by combining parts of publicly available datasets such as PubMed, the CORD19 dataset, and more. The presented system has the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort required by clinicians to access relevant patient information, allowing them to concentrate more on patient care and contribute to improved patient outcomes. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.
