This review explores their current use and uncovers areas needing more attention. Methods: This analysis followed systematic review procedures, registered with the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. We conducted a search across major databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus, up to December 2023, using keywords related to NLP, LLM, and infectious diseases. We also employed the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool for evaluating the quality and robustness of the included studies. Results: Our review identified 15 studies with diverse applications of NLP in infectious disease management. Notable examples include GPT-4's application in detecting urinary tract infections and BERTweet's use in Lyme Disease surveillance through social media analysis. These models demonstrated effective disease monitoring and public health tracking capabilities. However, the effectiveness varied across studies. For instance, while some NLP tools showed high accuracy in pneumonia detection and high sensitivity in identifying invasive mold diseases from medical reports, others fell short in areas like bloodstream infection management. Conclusions: This review highlights the yet-to-be-fully-realized promise of NLP and LLMs in infectious disease management. It calls for more exploration to fully harness AI's capabilities, particularly in the areas of diagnosis, surveillance, predicting disease courses, and tracking epidemiological trends. © 2024 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A field of study focusing on the interaction between computers and human language, with applications in infectious disease management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Advanced AI models used in various applications, including infectious disease management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A registry for systematic reviews, ensuring transparency and reducing duplication of research efforts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBMED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A major database for biomedical literature, used in the systematic review)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A comprehensive biomedical database, used in the systematic review)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEB OF SCIENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A multidisciplinary research database, used in the systematic review)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A large abstract and citation database, used in the systematic review)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY STUDIES-2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used to evaluate the quality and robustness of diagnostic accuracy studies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT-4<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A large language model used in detecting urinary tract infections)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERTWEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A language model used in Lyme Disease surveillance through social media analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSOCIATION FOR PROFESSIONALS IN INFECTION CONTROL AND EPIDEMIOLOGY, INC.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization that published the review)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>The application of NLP and LLMs in managing infectious diseases, including diagnosis, surveillance, and tracking epidemiological trends)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>NLP and LLMs are both fields of study and technologies used in infectious disease management<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>NLP is applied in various aspects of infectious disease management, including diagnosis and surveillance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>LLMs are used in infectious disease management for tasks such as disease monitoring and public health tracking<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-4<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>GPT-4 is used in detecting urinary tract infections as part of infectious disease management<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERTWEET<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>BERTweet is used in Lyme Disease surveillance through social media analysis as part of infectious disease management<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>The systematic review on NLP and LLMs in infectious disease management was registered with the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBMED<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>PubMed was one of the databases used in the systematic review on NLP and LLMs in infectious disease management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMBASE<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>Embase was one of the databases used in the systematic review on NLP and LLMs in infectious disease management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEB OF SCIENCE<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>Web of Science was one of the databases used in the systematic review on NLP and LLMs in infectious disease management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOPUS<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>Scopus was one of the databases used in the systematic review on NLP and LLMs in infectious disease management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY STUDIES-2<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool was used to evaluate studies in the systematic review on NLP and LLMs in infectious disease management<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION FOR PROFESSIONALS IN INFECTION CONTROL AND EPIDEMIOLOGY, INC.<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT<|>The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc. published the review on NLP and LLMs in infectious disease management<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
