This paper explores the profound impact of AI, particularly LLMs, in the field of medical image processing. The objective is to provide insights into the transformative potential of AI in improving healthcare by addressing historical challenges associated with manual image interpretation. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the Web of Science and PubMed databases from 2013 to 2023, focusing on the transformations of LLMs in Medical Imaging Processing. Recent publications on the arXiv database were also reviewed. Our search criteria included all types of articles, including abstracts, review articles, letters, and editorials. The language of publications was restricted to English to facilitate further content analysis. Key Content and Findings: The review reveals that AI, driven by LLMs, has revolutionized medical image processing by streamlining the interpretation process, traditionally characterized by time-intensive manual efforts. AI's impact on medical care quality and patient well-being is substantial. With their robust interactivity and multimodal learning capabilities, LLMs offer immense potential for enhancing various aspects of medical image processing. Additionally, the Transformer architecture, foundational to LLMs, is gaining prominence in this domain. Conclusions: In conclusion, this review underscores the pivotal role of AI, especially LLMs, in advancing medical image processing. These technologies have the capacity to enhance transfer learning efficiency, integrate multimodal data, facilitate clinical interactivity, and optimize cost-efficiency in healthcare. The potential applications of LLMs in clinical settings are promising, with far-reaching implications for future research, clinical practice, and healthcare policy. The transformative impact of AI in medical image processing is undeniable, and its continued development and implementation are poised to reshape the healthcare landscape for the better. © 2024 AME Publishing Company.
