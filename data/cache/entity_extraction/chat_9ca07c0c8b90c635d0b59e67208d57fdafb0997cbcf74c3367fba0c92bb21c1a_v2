These models have the potential to transform healthcare and medical research. However, understanding their applications and limitations is essential. Objectives: To present a view of ChatGPT research and to critically assess ChatGPT's role in medical writing and clinical environments. Methods: We performed a literature review via the PubMed search engine from 20 November 2022, to 23 April 2023. The search terms included ChatGPT, OpenAI, and large language models. We included studies that focused on ChatGPT, explored its use or implications in medicine, and were original research articles. The selected studies were analyzed considering study design, NLP tasks, main findings, and limitations. Results: Our study included 27 articles that examined ChatGPTs performance in various tasks and medical fields. These studies covered knowledge assessment, writing, and analysis tasks. While ChatGPT was found to be useful in tasks such as generating research ideas, aiding clinical reasoning, and streamlining workflows, limitations were also identified. These limitations included inaccuracies, inconsistencies, fictitious information, and limited knowledge, highlighting the need for further improvements. Conclusions: The review underscores ChatGPTś potential in various medical applications. Yet, it also points to limitations that require careful human oversight and responsible use to improve patient care, education, and decision-making. © 2024 Israel Medical Association.
