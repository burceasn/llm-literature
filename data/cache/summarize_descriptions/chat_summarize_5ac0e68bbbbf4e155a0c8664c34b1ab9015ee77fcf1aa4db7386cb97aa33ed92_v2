They authored a review on ethical issues in pain and palliative care, as well as a paper discussing the development of AI technology in Traditional Chinese Medicine, published under an exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. In 2024, The Author(s) conducted and published studies on ChatGPT's performance in the objective structured clinical examination, as well as a novel approach linking pulse and speech analysis for evaluating emotional responses in ALS patients. They also published a Personal View on advancements in AI for medical oncology and explored the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs) in medicine through systematic reviews and experiments.\n\nThe Author(s) have investigated ethical considerations surrounding LLMs, providing recommendations for future research and development. They introduced the BertTab model, conducted experiments, and developed the DL-PLUS model, which was evaluated in their research. Additionally, they explored ChatGPT's potential applications in managing infectious diseases and its impact on conversational AI. Their work also includes a study on NLP embeddings and HAC data analysis, as well as the introduction of BioLORD-2023, a model for biomedical semantic representation learning.\n\nThe Author(s) have published studies under exclusive licenses to Springer Nature Switzerland AG and Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, with some works appearing in journals published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association. They concluded that BERT pre-trained on PubMed abstracts is the best approach for PICO sentence classification and entity recognition in preclinical abstracts. Furthermore, they conducted research on mental health prediction using CETM and presented an improved method for relation extraction using large language models.\n\nOverall, The Author(s) are prolific researchers whose work spans ethical considerations, AI advancements, and practical applications in healthcare, with a strong focus on the development and evaluation of AI models and their implications in medicine and education.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092149, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 394, "prompt_tokens": 714, "total_tokens": 1108, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 650}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
