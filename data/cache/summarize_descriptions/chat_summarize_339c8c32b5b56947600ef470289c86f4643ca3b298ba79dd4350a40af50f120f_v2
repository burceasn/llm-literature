These tools have been evaluated for their potential applications in various fields, including vascular surgery, as demonstrated by an international survey. AI chatbots are capable of engaging with clinicians and patients, facilitating discussions about health conditions and risks. However, their utility is limited when it comes to providing diagnostic guidance and clinical advice, as they are not designed to replace professional medical judgment. \n\nIn a specific assessment focused on diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), AI chatbots were evaluated for their accuracy in providing information based on established guidelines. The results showed a mean accuracy of 91.2%, highlighting their potential as supplementary tools for disseminating medical information.
