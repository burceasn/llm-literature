These models are compared to BERT-based models, with the latter demonstrating superior performance across various tasks. Specifically, traditional machine learning models are evaluated against BERT-based models for pregnancy-related question classification, highlighting the advancements and effectiveness of BERT-based approaches over traditional methods. Overall, traditional machine learning models serve as a foundational reference point in the study, but they are consistently outperformed by more advanced BERT-based models.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092172, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 299, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 128}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
