In one pilot study, it was employed to assist in tumor board decision-making for head and neck cancer patients, demonstrating its capability to support clinical decision processes. Additionally, CHATGPT 3.5 was tested in the field of pathology, including Clinical Pathology, Histopathology, and Hematology, where it showed moderate proficiency in data analysis and decision support. However, the model exhibited limitations in generating detailed information, highlighting areas for improvement in its application within medical contexts.
