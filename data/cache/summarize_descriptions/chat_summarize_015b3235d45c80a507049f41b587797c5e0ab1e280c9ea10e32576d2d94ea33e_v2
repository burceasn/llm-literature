These models, such as GPT-3, are widely recognized for their capabilities in text generation, question answering, and other NLP tasks. LLMs have been extensively evaluated in biomedical text mining, where they contribute to tasks like entity identification, relationship extraction, and adverse drug event (ADE) extraction research. They leverage pre-trained models to enhance accuracy and efficiency in these domains. Additionally, LLMs are referenced as valuable tools in radiology workflows, where they optimize report generation and text data-mining, potentially integrating structured reporting into radiologists’ routines. Furthermore, they play a role in clinical decision support (CDS) systems, aiding in knowledge management through the analysis of general or domain-specific text corpora. Overall, LLMs represent a versatile and innovative approach to advancing AI applications across various fields, including healthcare, radiology, and biomedical research.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092155, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 472, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 211}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
