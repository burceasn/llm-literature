The group includes **136 patients** whose thyroid ultrasound reports were analyzed in a study, with a mean age of 52 years (±12 [SD]), including 61 males. These patients represent a broader population seeking medical advice and treatment for conditions such as **GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)**, **vascular diseases**, and **oral oncology**, where AI tools like **ChatGPT** play a significant role in early cancer detection, personalized treatment planning, and informed decision-making.\n\nPatients are key stakeholders in the healthcare sector, benefiting from AI-driven tools in multiple ways. They use **ChatGPT** and other **large language models (LLMs)** to seek information about medical procedures, such as the **IPP (implantable pulse generator)**, and to address radiation oncology-related questions. AI tools also assist in patient education, communication, and the summarization of medical documents, providing customized educational materials and triage suggestions. Additionally, patients may initiate changes to their medications as part of their healthcare management and share feedback about medications to raise public awareness and express their experiences, including adverse drug events (ADEs).\n\nIn psychiatric settings, patients participate in semi-structured interviews, contributing to the development of AI systems tailored to their needs. Their symptoms and queries often serve as the basis for questions posed to AI tools like ChatGPT, enhancing care through improved efficiency, optimized resource allocation, and superior outcomes. Overall, patients are individuals whose care is significantly enhanced by the integration of AI chatbots like **ChatGPT 4.0** and other AI-driven solutions in medicine, benefiting from personalized services, early interventions, and informed healthcare decisions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092146, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 359, "prompt_tokens": 478, "total_tokens": 837, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 414}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
