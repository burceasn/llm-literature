In one context, it is employed to derive six distinct language models aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of multi-label categorization in chest X-ray classification. This highlights its adaptability in handling complex tasks within the medical imaging domain. In another study, the BERT language model is used to analyze and cluster sentences from European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs), demonstrating its utility in processing and organizing textual data for regulatory and scientific purposes.
