In the context of GPT-3.5, zero-shot learning demonstrated high accuracy in identifying mentions of substance use, showcasing its capability to generalize from its pre-trained knowledge. Similarly, ChatGPT-4 has been applied in zero-shot learning for tasks such as symptom and sign extraction, achieving notable precision and recall metrics. However, zero-shot learning is often considered a baseline method in research studies, particularly when compared to more advanced approaches like few-shot learning, which involves providing a small number of examples to guide the model. Despite this, zero-shot learning remains a powerful and efficient method for various natural language processing tasks, leveraging the inherent generalization abilities of large language models like GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092147, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 368, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 133}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
