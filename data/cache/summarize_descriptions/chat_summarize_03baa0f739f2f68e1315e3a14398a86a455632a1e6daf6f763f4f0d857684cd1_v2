It identifies topics within unstructured data by analyzing the probability of word coherence scores, enabling the discovery of hidden thematic structures in text. In the context of this study, LDA is applied to generate unsupervised representations of disease sequences, demonstrating its utility in extracting meaningful patterns from complex, unstructured datasets. This approach leverages probabilistic modeling to uncover latent topics, making it a powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting large volumes of textual or sequential data.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092179, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 300, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 120}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
