Specifically, the review focuses on two key areas: healthcare and academic medicine. In healthcare, the scoping review seeks to identify studies that evaluate the performance of LLM-linked chatbots, exploring their potential roles and effectiveness in this field. In academic medicine, the review was conducted to assess the use of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, resulting in the development of five guideline statements. These guidelines provide structured recommendations for the integration and ethical use of LLMs in academic medical practices. Together, the scoping review highlights the growing interest in and potential of LLMs across healthcare and academic medicine, while also addressing the need for evidence-based guidelines to ensure their responsible application.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092139, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 112}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
