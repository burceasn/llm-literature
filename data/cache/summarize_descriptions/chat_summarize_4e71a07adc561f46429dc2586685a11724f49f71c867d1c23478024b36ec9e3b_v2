They are aided by AI systems, such as ChatGPT, which provide concise summaries, potential diagnoses, and assist in integrating medical imaging data with multiomics data to enhance patient outcomes. Physicians are responsible for documenting patient health information, including medical histories and treatments, in clinical texts. They also take a leading role in ensuring the ethical, humane, and evidence-based transformation of AI in clinical practice, particularly in specialized fields like hematology and oncology. \n\nIn addition to their clinical responsibilities, physicians' performance and interpersonal manner are often evaluated by patients through web-based reviews. To effectively utilize AI tools like ChatGPT, physicians require systematic training to improve their digital competence and ensure responsible use of the technology. In research settings, physicians have been involved in validating the algorithmic quality ratings of health content and conducting cognitive performance evaluations, with their results compared to those of NLP models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Overall, physicians are at the forefront of leveraging technology to improve healthcare delivery while maintaining high standards of patient care and ethical practice.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092137, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 232, "prompt_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 554, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 258}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
