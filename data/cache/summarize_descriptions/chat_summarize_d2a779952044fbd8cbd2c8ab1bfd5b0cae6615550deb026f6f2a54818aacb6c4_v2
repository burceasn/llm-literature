It serves as a versatile methodology and technology with significant applications across various domains, particularly in healthcare and biomedical research. In healthcare, NLP is employed for qualitative assessment of quality of life by analyzing unstructured patient comments, detecting depressive symptoms, and improving clinical research and early disease detection. It is also utilized in the development of tools like BGKnow to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis. \n\nWithin the biomedical domain, NLP techniques are widely adopted for text-analytics tasks, such as searching biomedical literature and extracting knowledge from biomedical data. Additionally, NLP plays a critical role in extracting Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health (SBDoH) information from unstructured clinical text, leveraging state-of-the-art transformer-based models like BERT and RoBERTa. Researchers have also developed NLP methods to extract Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) and their related attributes from clinical narrative text, further advancing patient safety and care. Furthermore, NLP technologies are integral to the development of medical chatbots, which improve patient diagnosis efficiency and streamline healthcare AI applications. Overall, NLP is a transformative technology with broad applications in improving healthcare outcomes, advancing biomedical research, and enhancing the efficiency of clinical processes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092160, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 261, "prompt_tokens": 369, "total_tokens": 630, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 305}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
