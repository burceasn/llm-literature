This approach is widely utilized in various studies and applications, including the use of pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet. In the context of the provided descriptions, transfer learning has been implemented in studies for tasks like mental health diagnostics, where pre-trained models are adapted to new domains. Additionally, it has been applied in the pre-training of Image Transformers using BERT, demonstrating its versatility across different types of data, such as text and images. Overall, transfer learning serves as a powerful method to leverage existing knowledge from pre-trained models, enabling efficient and effective solutions for new tasks.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092174, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 363, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 143}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
