Their research focused on evaluating the efficacy of LLMs in interpreting medical documentation and extracting preventive care information. To support this evaluation, the author(s) developed a specialized data structure designed to store annotated guidelines, which facilitated the assessment of LLMs' capabilities in processing and retrieving healthcare-related data. Additionally, the author(s) explored the broader potential applications and limitations of LLMs in the healthcare domain, addressing both their utility and the challenges they present. In a position paper, they further delved into the potentiality, risks, and ethical implications of deploying LLMs, providing a nuanced perspective on their integration into healthcare systems. Overall, the work of The Author(s) 2024 offers a detailed examination of LLMs, highlighting their promise while critically addressing their limitations and ethical considerations in the context of healthcare.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092201, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 255, "total_tokens": 449, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 191}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
