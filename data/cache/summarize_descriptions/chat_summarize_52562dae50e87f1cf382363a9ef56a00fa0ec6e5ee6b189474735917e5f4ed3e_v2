It serves as a key resource for systematically identifying and selecting primary articles relevant to specific research topics. For instance, it has been employed in systematic reviews to gather studies on artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) in medical image processing, as well as to identify articles related to case reports of foreign body injuries in children. As one of the primary electronic databases searched in systematic reviews, WEB OF SCIENCE facilitates comprehensive and methodical literature searches, ensuring the inclusion of pertinent studies in the review process. Its versatility and breadth of coverage make it an essential tool for researchers conducting systematic literature reviews across diverse disciplines.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092159, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 386, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 179}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
