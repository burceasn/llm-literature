It serves as a foundational language model that generates contextualized word embeddings, capturing the nuances of language by considering the surrounding context of words. ELMo is particularly noted for its application as a baseline model in studies aimed at predicting provider-assigned labels from free-text chief complaints, showcasing its utility in tasks that require understanding and processing unstructured text data. Overall, ELMo represents a significant advancement in NLP, offering robust and context-aware embeddings for various language-related applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092189, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 296, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 112}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
