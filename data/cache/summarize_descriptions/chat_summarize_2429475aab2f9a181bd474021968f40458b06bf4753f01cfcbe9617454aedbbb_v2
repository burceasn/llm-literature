It is the latest model in the ChatGPT series and is widely recognized for its superior performance across various applications, particularly in high-risk settings such as healthcare. GPT-4 has been fine-tuned and evaluated for numerous specialized tasks, including generating Chief Complaint documentation, detecting urinary tract infections, and identifying patients with specific diseases, such as in the PBC (Primary Biliary Cholangitis) use case. It has also demonstrated exceptional accuracy and efficiency in medical examinations, including the Spanish MIR medical examination and Japan's National Medical Licensing Examination, where it achieved a minimum passing scoring rate with optimized prompts.\n\nIn addition to its clinical applications, GPT-4 has been utilized for generating synthetic data, augmenting training datasets, and improving relation extraction techniques when integrated with systems like Gemini. It has shown promise in concept extraction, SQL query generation, and reasoning tasks, particularly in the C2Q 3.0 framework. GPT-4 has also been evaluated for its proficiency in identifying fake news, screening clinical research papers, and performing aspect-based sentiment analysis in healthcare. Furthermore, it has been explored for its potential applications in biomedical engineering and dermatology knowledge retrieval, though it faces challenges in accuracy and consistency in some areas, such as medical response editing.\n\nGPT-4 has been compared to other models, such as Llama 2, and has consistently demonstrated superior performance, including outperforming the average PGY-5 level on the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE). It has also been evaluated for its cognitive performance, yielding results closer to physician ratings, indicating its potential for further enhancement in medical and cognitive tasks. Despite its advanced capabilities, GPT-4 is one of four large language models assessed for value-like constructs and decision-making biases, highlighting the ongoing need for careful evaluation and optimization in its deployment. Overall, GPT-4 stands out as a versatile and powerful tool with transformative potential across diverse domains, particularly in healthcare and artificial intelligence.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092131, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 410, "prompt_tokens": 658, "total_tokens": 1068, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 0, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 658}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
