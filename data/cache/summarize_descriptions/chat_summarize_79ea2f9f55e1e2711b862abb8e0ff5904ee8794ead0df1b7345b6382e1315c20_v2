It serves as a primary resource for researchers across various domains, including dermatology, artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), healthcare, and psychedelic medicine. PubMed is extensively used in systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and comprehensive literature searches to identify and retrieve peer-reviewed studies, meta-analyses, and case reports. For instance, it has been utilized to gather primary articles for systematic literature reviews on AI applications in dermatology, machine learning methodologies for adverse drug event (ADE) extraction, and the intersection of AI with psychedelic medicine. Additionally, PubMed has been instrumental in research involving ChatGPT, including its applications in plastic surgery, heart failure (HF) care, and medical image processing. The database is also a key source of data for training and testing deep learning models, as well as for creating datasets like PubMedRS-200. Its vast repository, which includes nearly 1 million articles added annually, makes it a reputable and specialized tool for biomedical research. Despite its widespread use and recent improvements, PubMed continues to face challenges in the evolving fields of healthcare and biomedicine. Overall, PubMed is an indispensable electronic platform for accessing and analyzing biomedical literature, supporting a wide range of research endeavors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092145, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 274, "prompt_tokens": 655, "total_tokens": 929, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 591}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
