They were responsible for validating the gold standard for TN classification, which was based on pathology reports, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the classification system. Additionally, these experts evaluated 100 samples to assist in fine-tuning the Large Language Model (LLM) method for label extraction, contributing to the optimization and precision of the model. Their expertise and evaluations were instrumental in enhancing both the TN classification framework and the LLM's performance in extracting relevant labels.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092166, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 166, "total_tokens": 288, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 102}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
