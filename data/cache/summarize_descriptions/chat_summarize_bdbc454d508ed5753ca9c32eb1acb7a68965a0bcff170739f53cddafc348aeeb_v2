These tasks encompass a variety of functions, including clinical concept extraction, medical relation extraction, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference (NLI), and medical question answering (MQA). The primary goal of these tasks is to process and analyze healthcare-related data, enabling the extraction of meaningful insights and facilitating improved decision-making in clinical settings. Additionally, Clinical NLP tasks are used to evaluate the robustness of large language models (LLMs) to variations in instruction phrasing, ensuring their reliability and effectiveness in interpreting and responding to medical language. Overall, Clinical NLP tasks play a critical role in advancing the integration of NLP technologies into healthcare, enhancing both research and practical applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092148, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 165}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
