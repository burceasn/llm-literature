It involves leveraging pre-trained models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment analysis, where it improves efficiency by building on existing knowledge. Additionally, transfer learning is employed in fine-tuning pretrained language models for task-specific downstream applications, including biomedical language processing, where it adapts general models to specialized tasks. Beyond NLP, transfer learning is a foundational principle in developing deep neural network models for automating complex tasks like evidence table generation. Furthermore, it is recognized as a key capability of large language models (LLMs), enhancing efficiency in diverse AI applications, such as medical image processing. Overall, transfer learning serves as a critical tool for optimizing model performance and reducing computational costs across a broad spectrum of machine learning applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092170, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 386, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 150}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
