In one application, it was used to evaluate the overall satisfaction of people living with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). The responses were authored by both ChatGPT and neurologists, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of satisfaction levels. In another context, the Likert scale was utilized to grade Natural Language Processing (NLP) responses based on criteria such as relevance, completeness, and accuracy. This demonstrates the scale's adaptability in measuring subjective experiences, such as patient satisfaction, as well as objective evaluations, such as the quality of NLP outputs. Overall, the Likert scale serves as a reliable method for quantifying responses across diverse domains.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092169, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 321, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 116}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
