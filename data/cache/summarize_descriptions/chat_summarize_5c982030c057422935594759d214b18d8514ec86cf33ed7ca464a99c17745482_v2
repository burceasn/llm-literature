The first objective involves evaluating the application of ChatGPT in multidisciplinary team (MDT) decision-making for head and neck cancer patients. This aspect of the study included 20 patients and aimed to assess how ChatGPT could assist in clinical decision-making processes. The second objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of five representative sentence similarity models within the clinical domain. This component of the research sought to determine the performance and applicability of these models in analyzing and comparing clinical text data. Together, these two aspects of the PILOT STUDY provide insights into the integration of advanced language models and similarity algorithms in healthcare settings, particularly in the context of cancer care and clinical decision support.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092185, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 329, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 110}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
