They require interpretable and explainable results from AI systems to support clinical decision-making, ensuring that the tools align with their professional standards and ethical considerations. Clinicians benefit from AI by automating routine tasks, which alleviates their workload and allows them to focus more on direct patient care. They use advanced AI tools, such as ChatGPT 4.0, to access Simplified Patient Summaries, relevant academic literature, and to enhance their clinical reasoning and diagnostic skills. Additionally, clinicians are involved in annotating medical data, such as text snippets for heart failure symptoms and signs, and have participated in studies comparing their original differential diagnoses, such as those in PICU admission notes, to those generated by language models.\n\nClinicians also recognize the transformative potential of AI in healthcare practice while addressing associated risks, including ethical challenges and medicolegal concerns. They are exploring the use of large language models (LLMs) for automated medical documentation, diagnosis, and treatment, which could further streamline healthcare workflows. In psychiatric settings, clinicians have participated in semi-structured interviews to provide insights into the integration of AI tools. Furthermore, they aim to apply AI and machine learning (ML) in specialized areas like resuscitation research, though they face challenges in staying updated with the latest advancements in the rapidly evolving field of AI. Overall, clinicians play a critical role in adopting, evaluating, and refining AI technologies to improve healthcare delivery while balancing innovation with patient safety and ethical responsibility.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092143, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 315, "prompt_tokens": 397, "total_tokens": 712, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 333}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
