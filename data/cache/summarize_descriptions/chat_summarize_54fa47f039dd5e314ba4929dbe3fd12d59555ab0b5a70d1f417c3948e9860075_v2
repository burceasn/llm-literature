Healthcare professionals are actively exploring the potential of LLMs to enhance patient care, advance research, and improve educational practices. These models offer valuable tools for processing and generating information, which can support decision-making and knowledge dissemination. However, healthcare professionals recognize the importance of rigorously validating the information extracted by LLMs to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This validation process is critical to mitigate potential biases and errors, ensuring that the use of LLMs in healthcare remains safe, ethical, and effective. By combining their expertise with the capabilities of LLMs, healthcare professionals aim to leverage these technologies responsibly to improve outcomes in patient care, research, and education.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092223, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 330, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 51}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
