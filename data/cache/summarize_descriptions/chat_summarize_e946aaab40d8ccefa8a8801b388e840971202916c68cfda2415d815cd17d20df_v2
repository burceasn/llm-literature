It is a sector where AI technologies, including multimodal systems, transformer architectures, and Large Language Models (LLMs), are being widely adopted to address a variety of challenges and improve patient care. These technologies are applied across numerous tasks, such as medical question answering, clinical diagnosis, medical imaging analysis, drug synthesis, and patient history analysis. AI is also being utilized to organize and provide insights from clinical and patient records, enhance diagnostic accuracy, tailor treatment plans, and predict patient outcomes.\n\nIn addition to clinical applications, AI is revolutionizing healthcare by improving public sentiment analysis, electronic health record (EHR) screening, patient communication, and drug prescription processes, including the identification of adverse drug events (ADEs). Sentiment analysis and topic extraction from social media are also being leveraged to gain insights into public health trends and patient experiences. Furthermore, intelligent question-answering systems and AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, are being integrated into healthcare to provide solutions for patient queries, support clinical practice, and enhance hospital management.\n\nThe integration of LLMs is particularly notable in personalized healthcare, where they are used to augment clinical practice, improve diagnostic accuracy, and predict patient outcomes. AI-based devices are increasingly being employed for tasks such as image data processing, biomarker prediction, and differential diagnosis. Overall, AI, NLP, and LLMs are transforming healthcare by improving patient-centric utilities, provider support systems, and overall healthcare interactions, making it a key domain for innovation and research.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092144, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 323, "prompt_tokens": 673, "total_tokens": 996, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 609}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
