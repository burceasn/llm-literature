It is particularly relevant in applications such as health care and medical computer vision. For instance, prompt engineering has been utilized to evaluate GPT-4's performance in a zero-shot setup for classifying radiology reports, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex medical data. Additionally, it has been explored as a technique to enhance the performance of foundation AI models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) in medical computer vision applications, showcasing its versatility across different domains of artificial intelligence.
