It is a large pretrained language model that has significantly improved information extraction systems and is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. GPT is capable of generating human-like text and has been applied across various domains, including chemical informatics, where it has been extensively explored. Additionally, GPT has been utilized for extracting Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and serves as a benchmark in comparisons with other models, such as LLaMA-2, for tasks like Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI)-related literature identification. As an innovative AI technology, GPT continues to demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness in a wide range of applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092145, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 425, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 199}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
