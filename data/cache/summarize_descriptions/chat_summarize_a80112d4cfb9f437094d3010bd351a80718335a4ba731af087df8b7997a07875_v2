It leverages machine learning algorithms, such as BERT, to analyze human sentiment expression across various domains, including business, social media, healthcare, and disaster response. This process is widely applied to assess public sentiment, such as reactions to COVID-19 vaccines, and to evaluate customer reviews for products like medications, providing insights into efficacy and popularity. Sentiment analysis also plays a critical role in opinion mining, health informatics, and recommender systems by systematically extracting and studying affective states and subjective information from text. Additionally, it is used to analyze social media comments to understand public sentiments and their broader implications. Despite its versatility, the technique faces challenges such as detecting sarcasm, irony, and ensuring ethical use. Overall, sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding and interpreting human emotions and opinions in diverse contexts, from E-commerce and healthcare to hotel business and beyond.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092135, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 369, "total_tokens": 576, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 305}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
