It is particularly useful in the context of interpretable AI, where understanding the decision-making process of complex models, such as pretrained large language models (LLMs), is essential. LIME achieves this by approximating the behavior of the model locally around a specific prediction, providing insights into how the model arrives at its decisions. This technique is model-agnostic, meaning it can be applied to a wide range of machine learning models, making it a versatile tool for enhancing transparency and interpretability in AI systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092131, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 327, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 0, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 187}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
