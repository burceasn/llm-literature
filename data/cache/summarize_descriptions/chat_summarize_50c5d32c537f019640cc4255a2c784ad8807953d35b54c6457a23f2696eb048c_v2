The first group is a cohort of 351 female breast cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and subsequent surgery between 2010 and 2017 in Calgary, forming the study population. These patients were part of a specific medical study focused on the outcomes of NAC and surgical intervention. The second group encompasses a broader population of breast cancer patients who participate in discussions on Breastcancer.org, sharing their experiences, seeking support, and engaging in community-driven conversations about their condition. While the first group is defined by their participation in a clinical study, the second group represents a wider, more diverse population of individuals affected by breast cancer who connect through an online platform for mutual support and information exchange.
