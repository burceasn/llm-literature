They are responsible for manually curating highly accurate Biological Expression Language (BEL) knowledge graphs, which are used for comparison with automated extraction results. Additionally, domain experts collaborate with AI researchers to develop ready-to-use Explainable AI (XAI) methods, leveraging their expertise to bridge the gap between healthcare and NLP. They also guided the development of TREAT-ISE, a dataset designed for analyzing health-related information-seeking events on Reddit. As part of their contributions, domain experts manually annotated 273 Reddit posts used in the study, ensuring the dataset's accuracy and relevance for research purposes. Overall, domain experts are essential in combining their specialized knowledge with AI advancements to enhance data quality and develop practical AI solutions in healthcare and NLP domains.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092143, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 404, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 159}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
