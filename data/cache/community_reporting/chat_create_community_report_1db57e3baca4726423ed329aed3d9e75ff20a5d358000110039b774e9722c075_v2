It serves as a primary resource for researchers across various domains, including dermatology, artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), healthcare, and psychedelic medicine. PubMed is extensively used in systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and comprehensive literature searches to identify and retrieve peer-reviewed studies, meta-analyses, and case reports. For instance, it has been utilized to gather primary articles for systematic literature reviews on AI applications in dermatology, machine learning methodologies for adverse drug event (ADE) extraction, and the intersection of AI with psychedelic medicine. Additionally, PubMed has been instrumental in research involving ChatGPT, including its applications in plastic surgery, heart failure (HF) care, and medical image processing. The database is also a key source of data for training and testing deep learning models, as well as for creating datasets like PubMedRS-200. Its vast repository, which includes nearly 1 million articles added annually, makes it a reputable and specialized tool for biomedical research.
