These models, which include well-known examples such as BERT, CT-BERT, large language models (LLMs), and generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), are employed for a variety of NLP tasks. For instance, they are utilized in fake news detection, where their ability to process and analyze text data is leveraged to identify misleading information. Additionally, transformer-based models play a significant role in question generation (QG), where they generate questions that are more contextually aware of the answers, enhancing the quality of automated question-answering systems. In a specific study, fifteen transformer-based models were used to extract embeddings from pathology reports, demonstrating their versatility in handling specialized and domain-specific text data. Overall, transformer-based models represent a powerful and flexible approach in NLP, capable of addressing diverse challenges across various applications.\",13\r\n1568,RHEUMATOLOGY,\"Rheumatology is a medical field focused on diagnosing and managing rheumatic diseases, where NLP and LLMs are being applied to improve outcomes\",4\r\n56,LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS,\"Large Language Models (LLMs) are a category of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models, including prominent examples such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Google Bard, Gemini-pro, and Claude-3. These models are based on transformer architectures and are designed to process, understand, and generate human-like text. LLMs have become foundational tools in natural language processing (NLP), with applications spanning various domains, including healthcare, research, and clinical decision-making.\n\nIn healthcare, LLMs are being leveraged to enhance diagnostic accuracy, patient care, and medical writing. They are used in dermatology to answer questions about skin diagnoses, though concerns about inaccuracies have been noted. In rheumatology, they contribute to improving diagnostic precision and patient outcomes. Additionally, LLMs are employed in medical chatbots to provide progressive healthcare solutions and are integrated into electronic health record systems to process clinical text. They have also shown unprecedented performance in answering medical questions and supporting clinical decisions, making them valuable tools in public health and clinical environments.\n\nBeyond healthcare, LLMs are utilized in research and development, including MMQA (Multi-Modal Question Answering) research, where they focus on advanced text understanding and generation. They are also foundational to Graph Foundation Models and are fine-tuned for tasks such as extracting biological interactions from literature. LLMs are discussed in conferences for applications like entity matching, data cleaning, and knowledge graph construction. Furthermore, they are being employed in cancer research to tackle new dimensions of problems and are used as baselines in studies on detecting mental health disorders.\n\nLLMs are a type of generative AI capable of summarizing and synthesizing medical evidence, generating synthetic data, and improving interpretability and explainability in healthcare NLP through the integration of XAI (Explainable AI) techniques. Their versatility and advanced capabilities make them pivotal in advancing AI-driven solutions across multiple fields, from clinical terminology systems like FHIR to broader NLP-MHI (Natural Language Processing for Mental Health Informatics) studies.
