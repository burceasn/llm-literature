It has been extensively evaluated across various domains, particularly in healthcare and medical research, where it demonstrates significant potential. In the context of surgical management, CHATGPT-4 has been assessed for providing recommendations on GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and predicting Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes from surgical operative notes using advanced techniques such as prompt engineering, NLP, and machine learning. Additionally, it has been employed to generate 180 synthetic clinical notes for external validation in research studies.\n\nCHATGPT-4 has shown promise in addressing patient queries and delivering reliable information, such as epilepsy-related content, though its performance can vary, particularly in verbal interactions, and it may be less effective than specialized AI tools like AIVA. In orthognathic surgery, it has demonstrated high originality in similarity assessments, and in audiology, it has been evaluated for its performance in the 2023 Taiwan Audiologist Qualification Examination, indicating potential applications in hearing care services. Furthermore, CHATGPT-4 has been tested for its accuracy in troubleshooting CRRT (continuous renal replacement therapy) machine alarms, achieving impressive accuracy rates of 90% and 94% in two rounds of testing.\n\nBeyond clinical applications, CHATGPT-4 has been utilized to debunk sleep-related myths, achieving 85.0% accuracy in identifying false statements and focusing on theoretical aspects of sleep. Overall, CHATGPT-4 is a versatile AI model that excels in information sharing, pattern recognition, outcome prediction, and providing insights based on patient data and medical reports, making it a valuable tool in both research and practical healthcare settings.\",27\r\n377,CHATGPT-3.5,\"CHATGPT-3.5 is a large language model powered by artificial intelligence, designed to assist in a wide range of tasks, particularly in the healthcare domain. It has been evaluated for its ability to provide recommendations on the surgical management of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), demonstrating its potential in clinical decision-making. Additionally, CHATGPT-3.5 has been utilized to review and categorize CIRS (critical incident reporting system) cases, showcasing its capabilities in data analysis and information organization within medical studies. The model has also been employed to generate structured thyroid ultrasound reports, where it excels in creating structured reports but shows lower accuracy in nodule categorization and management recommendations. Furthermore, CHATGPT-3.5 has been compared to its successor, CHATGPT-4, in studies focusing on healthcare information access and data analysis. In another evaluation, CHATGPT-3.5 was tested for its accuracy in addressing CRRT (continuous renal replacement therapy) machine alarm troubleshooting queries, achieving accuracy rates of 86% and 84% in two rounds of testing, highlighting its utility in technical medical support.
