It is particularly significant in the fields of clinical language understanding, biomedical text mining, and medical natural language processing (NLP). The task involves analyzing text to detect and categorize relationships between entities, such as gene-disease associations, and organizing these relationships into structured formats like ordered tuples.

It involves identifying and classifying key entities within text, such as names, dates, locations, drug names, genes, proteins, and diseases. In the medical and biomedical domains, NER plays a critical role in text mining and analysis. For instance, it is utilized by models like SpaCy and Clinical Longformer to extract specific information, such as UTI symptoms, from unstructured clinical notes in emergency department (ED) settings. NER is essential for organizing and interpreting large volumes of text data, enabling the extraction of structured information from unstructured sources. Its applications span various fields, including healthcare, where it aids in identifying medical entities, and biomedical research, where it helps in recognizing biological terms like genes and proteins.
