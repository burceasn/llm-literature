Specifically, the review focuses on two key areas: healthcare and academic medicine. In healthcare, the scoping review seeks to identify studies that evaluate the performance of LLM-linked chatbots, exploring their potential roles and effectiveness in this field. In academic medicine, the review was conducted to assess the use of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, resulting in the development of five guideline statements. These guidelines provide structured recommendations for the integration and ethical use of LLMs in academic medical practices. Together, the scoping review highlights the growing interest in and potential of LLMs across healthcare and academic medicine, while also addressing the need for evidence-based guidelines to ensure their responsible application.\",5\r\n75,MEDLINE,\"MEDLINE is a reputable biomedical and medical database widely utilized for searching and extracting primary literature across various fields of research. It has been employed in multiple scoping and systematic reviews to identify relevant publications on diverse topics, including artificial intelligence (AI) applications in dermatology, natural language processing (NLP) applications in vascular surgery, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction research, and the use of ChatGPT and large language models (LLMs) in academic medicine and heart failure (HF) care. Specifically, MEDLINE was searched in April 2023 for studies on NLP applications in vascular surgery, highlighting its role as a key resource for accessing up-to-date and credible scientific literature.
