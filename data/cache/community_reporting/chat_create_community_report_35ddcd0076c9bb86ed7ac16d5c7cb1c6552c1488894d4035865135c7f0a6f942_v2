In the context of GPT-3.5, zero-shot learning demonstrated high accuracy in identifying mentions of substance use, showcasing its capability to generalize from its pre-trained knowledge. Similarly, ChatGPT-4 has been applied in zero-shot learning for tasks such as symptom and sign extraction, achieving notable precision and recall metrics. However, zero-shot learning is often considered a baseline method in research studies, particularly when compared to more advanced approaches like few-shot learning, which involves providing a small number of examples to guide the model.
