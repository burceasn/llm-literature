In the context of GPT-3.5, zero-shot learning demonstrated high accuracy in identifying mentions of substance use, showcasing its capability to generalize from its pre-trained knowledge. Similarly, ChatGPT-4 has been applied in zero-shot learning for tasks such as symptom and sign extraction, achieving notable precision and recall metrics. However, zero-shot learning is often considered a baseline method in research studies, particularly when compared to more advanced approaches like few-shot learning, which involves providing a small number of examples to guide the model. Despite this, zero-shot learning remains a powerful and efficient method for various natural language processing tasks, leveraging the inherent generalization abilities of large language models like GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4.\",7\r\n174,PSYCHEDELIC MEDICINES,\"Psychedelic medicines are evolving disruptive innovations in mental healthcare, with potential applications in drug discovery, clinical trials, and personalized treatments>\",3\r\n1925,DUAL USE,,1\r\n1978,MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS,\"Mental health disorders are a global health concern, affecting approximately one in seven people worldwide. These disorders significantly impact individuals' thinking, feelings, and behavior, often leading to severe consequences if left untreated. They are a major contributor to suicide, underscoring the critical need for early detection and intervention to enhance the effectiveness of therapy and improve overall well-being. Proper treatment and support are essential for recovery, as these disorders can profoundly disrupt daily life and mental stability. In recent years, mental health disorders have become a focal point of research, with advancements in technology, such as AI systems, being developed to detect signs of these disorders through the analysis of social media texts.

In one study, GPT-3.5 demonstrated improved recall and F1-score for identifying substance use status, albeit at the expense of precision, highlighting the trade-offs inherent in few-shot learning approaches. This method has also been applied to predict rare disease areas, where the scarcity of data poses significant challenges. Additionally, few-shot learning has been investigated in the context of biomedical natural language processing (NLP) tasks, with a focus on understanding the impact of interpretability on model performance.
