It encompasses a wide range of applications across various sectors, including healthcare, biotechnology, agriculture, education, finance, and social media. AI leverages advanced techniques such as machine learning (ML), neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Sora to enable intelligent functions such as knowledge acquisition, problem-solving, decision-making, and data analysis.\n\nIn healthcare, AI plays a pivotal role in enhancing diagnostic capabilities, clinical decision-making, and patient care. It is integrated into medical diagnostics, including ophthalmology chatbots, cancer diagnosis systems, and tools for analyzing unstructured data in electronic health records (EHRs). AI-powered systems assist radiologists, improve clinical validation, and mitigate biases in medical diagnostics. It is also used in predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic studies in cancer research, as well as in oral oncology for advancing diagnosis, therapy, and patient care. AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, are being utilized to improve medical writing, laboratory test interpretation, and the analysis of medical literature. Additionally, AI supports mental wellness by analyzing social media data for patterns of suicidal behavior or emotional distress and enhances mental health interventions.\n\nBeyond healthcare, AI is applied in biotechnology, sustainability, and global problem-solving. It is used in agriculture to address challenges in developing nations, in education for surgical training and ethical challenges, and in retailing and social media for operational efficiency and business transformation. However, its rapid adoption raises ethical concerns, including algorithmic bias, data privacy, and job displacement, necessitating responsible deployment and oversight by human experts.\n\nAI is also integrated into digital healthcare systems for anonymizing and processing health information, automating tasks like PPM classification to reduce workload, and enhancing Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis and treatment systems through NLP. Its transformative potential extends to communication strategies, where it disrupts traditional approaches, and to industries like gynecology, where it addresses critical women’s health issues using ML and deep learning (DL).\n\nOverall, AI is a versatile and impactful technology that continues to evolve, offering significant benefits while posing challenges that require careful management to ensure ethical and effective implementation.\",96\r\n749,ORAL ONCOLOGY,\"Oral oncology is a medical field focused on the diagnosis and treatment of cancers affecting the oral cavity, where AI tools like ChatGPT are being integrated to improve outcomes.\",2\r\n865,CARDIOVASCULAR CT,\"Cardiovascular CT is a medical imaging technique that is being transformed by AI, with debates on its future and applications\",2\r\n866,HIGH RISK PLAQUE (HRP),\"High Risk Plaque (HRP) is a topic of debate in cardiovascular CT, focusing on its detection and analysis using AI\",2\r\n867,QUANTITATIVE PLAQUE ANALYSIS,Quantitative Plaque Analysis is a method in cardiovascular CT that is being enhanced by AI for improved accuracy and consistency,2\r\n1042,DIGITAL HEALTHCARE,Digital healthcare is an area where LLMs are being applied to advance personalized treatments and improve clinical decision-making>,2\r\n645,SPANISH LANGUAGE,The Spanish language is the primary focus of this research study on mental health detection,1\r\n1014,CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN),CNN is a type of neural network used for extracting features from images with high accuracy,1\r\n1120,ULTRASOUND TECHNOLOGY,Ultrasound technology is integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) during pregnancy stages and has diverse applications throughout each trimester,1\r\n1177,MALQUE PUBLISHING,Malque Publishing is the organization that holds the rights to the text discussing the incorporation of AI in Nursing Education,1\r\n1355,SURGICAL EDUCATION,Surgical education is identified as a field with increasing AI applications since 2018,1\r\n1356,ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS,Ethical frameworks are called for to address bias and equity in educational AI applications,1\r\n1357,DIVERSE DEVELOPER TEAMS,Diverse developer teams are emphasized as necessary to address bias and equity in AI applications,1\r\n1909,SKIN CANCER DETECTION APPS,\"Mobile applications using AI for skin cancer detection, part of the rapid deployment of AI in dermatology\",1\r\n1914,PRIVACY VIOLATIONS,An ethical concern in dermatology related to the use of AI and data security,1\r\n1915,DERMATOLOGIST JOBS,A concern in dermatology where AI applications may replace dermatologist jobs,1\r\n2170,RESPONSIBLE AI,\"Responsible AI refers to principles like fairness, reliability, and accountability that businesses and policymakers are urged to adopt to ensure AI serves the greater good while mitigating risks.\",1\r\n2171,AGENTIC AI,\"Agentic AI represents a future advancement in artificial intelligence, focusing on systems that can act autonomously and make decisions, holding both enormous potential and severe risks.\",1\r\n2172,ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE (AGI),\"Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a future form of AI that aims to achieve human-like cognitive abilities, with significant potential and risks.\",1\r\n2173,ARTIFICIAL SUPERINTELLIGENCE (ASI),\"Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) is a theoretical future AI system that surpasses human intelligence, holding both enormous potential and severe risks.\",1\r\n2176,RETAILING,,1\r\n2174,HEALTHCARE DIAGNOSTICS,Healthcare diagnostics is a field where artificial intelligence is applied to improve accuracy and efficiency in medical diagnoses.,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3309,NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP),PUBLISHING,Natural Language Processing has applications in publishing,136\r\n227,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI),HEALTHCARE,\"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being utilized in the healthcare sector to enhance various aspects of medical practice and patient care.
