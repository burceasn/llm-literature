However, there remains limited understanding regarding the efficacy of ChatGPT in addressing commonly asked questions on public health subjects. This study aimed to investigate whether ChatGPT could appropriately answer frequently asked questions related to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Methods Ten frequently asked questions on STDs were gathered from 25 different government agency websites. The questions were inputted into ChatGPT and subsequent responses were analyzed for accuracy, clarity, and appropriateness using an evidence-based approach on a 4-point grading scale. Results Of the responses provided by ChatGPT, four were determined to be excellent requiring no clarification and six requiring minimal clarification. No responses were graded as unsatisfactory. Additionally, the responses appropriately emphasized consulting a healthcare specialist. Conclusion While the majority of responses required minimal clarification, ChatGPT has the potential to be an effective supplementary tool for patient education. Additional research is necessary to explore possible public health strategies that incorporate artificial intelligence to address concerns related to STDs. Â© 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.
