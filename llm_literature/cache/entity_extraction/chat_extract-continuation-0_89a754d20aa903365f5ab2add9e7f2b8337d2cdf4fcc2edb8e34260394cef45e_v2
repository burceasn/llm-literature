This review aims to the elucidate the current condition of GAI technologies and their particular uses in the field of PHE. Data were extracted and analyzed from studies focusing on the demographics and professional development preferences of healthcare workers, the competencies required for personalized precision medicine, and the current and potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in PHE. The review also addressed the ethical implications of AI implementation in this context. Findings indicated a gender-balanced healthcare workforce with a predisposition toward continuous professional development and digital tool utilization. A need for a comprehensive educational framework was identified to include a spectrum of skills crucial for precision medicine, emphasizing the importance of patient involvement and bioethics. AI was found to enhance educational experiences and research in PHE, with an increasing trend in AI applications, particularly in surgical education since 2018. Ethical challenges associated with AI integration in PHE were highlighted, with an emphasis on the need for ethical design and diverse development teams. Core concepts in AI research were established, with a spotlight on emerging areas such as data science and learning analytics. The application of AI in PHE was recognized for its current benefits and potential for future advancements, with a call for ethical vigilance. GAI holds significant promise for personalizing PHE, with an identified need for ethical frameworks and diverse developer teams to address bias and equity in educational AI applications.
