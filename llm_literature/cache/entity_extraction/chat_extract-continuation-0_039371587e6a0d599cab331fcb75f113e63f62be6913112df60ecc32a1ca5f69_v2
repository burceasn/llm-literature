In the paper, we achieve automatic AD detection by leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for linguistic analysis applied to the ADReSS/ADReSSo (Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech/only) Challenges datasets, following speech-to-text conversion. While the recent advancements in LLMs offer a robust foundation for their application in healthcare, fine-tuning these models for specific tasks, like AD detection, requires optimization to balance performance and computational efficiency. Also in response to data privacy concerns in healthcare, we implement our methodology on consumer-level GPU cards, which offer a practical solution for local data processing. Our approach uses fine-tuning techniques such as Low Ranking Adaptation and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models within the limits of consumer-grade hardware. Additionally, we incorporate quantization to reduce computational demands while preserving model accuracy. Conducted on setups with RTX 4090 and dual RTX 3090 GPUs, our experiments demonstrate promising results that align with or surpass existing benchmarks in dementia recognition. © 2024 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD)<|>EVENT<|>A condition impacting approximately 50 million individuals globally, which is the focus of the research for developing improved diagnostic tools)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADRESS/ADRESSO CHALLENGES<|>EVENT<|>Datasets used for Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech, applied in the research for linguistic analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pre-trained models leveraged for linguistic analysis in the research to achieve automatic Alzheimer's Disease detection)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RTX 4090<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Consumer-level GPU card used in the research for local data processing and fine-tuning of Large Language Models)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RTX 3090<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Consumer-level GPU card used in the research for local data processing and fine-tuning of Large Language Models)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization that published the research paper in 2024)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD)<|>ADRESS/ADRESSO CHALLENGES<|>The ADReSS/ADReSSo Challenges datasets are used for research on Alzheimer's Disease detection<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ADRESS/ADRESSO CHALLENGES<|>Large Language Models are applied to the ADReSS/ADReSSo Challenges datasets for linguistic analysis<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RTX 4090<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>RTX 4090 GPUs are used to fine-tune Large Language Models for Alzheimer's Disease detection<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RTX 3090<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>RTX 3090 GPUs are used to fine-tune Large Language Models for Alzheimer's Disease detection<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IEEE<|>ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD)<|>IEEE published the research paper focusing on Alzheimer's Disease detection<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
