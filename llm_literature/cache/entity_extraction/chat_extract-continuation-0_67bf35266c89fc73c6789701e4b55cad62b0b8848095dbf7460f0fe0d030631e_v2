Open AI uses human AI trainers to fine-tune the language models and utilize human feedback and reinforcement learning techniques, allowing ChatGPT to be used in various industries and fields, such as customer support, content creation, programming assistance, and more. Respectively, it is expected for ChatGPT to find its way in the medical field, as a tool that could enhance diagnosis, patient communication, and medical research. This paper presents the recently developed technology of ChatGPT as a tool that could be used in medical practice, exploring its advantages, disadvantages, ethical issues, and future possibilities. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The string ‘((ChatGPT OR GPT) AND (medicine))’ was used in Google Scholar as a search strategy. The included studies represent the published articles and what we judged as having a significant impact in this field to outline the examined topic. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: While ChatGPT could serve as a clinical assistant, aiding in note writing, patient inquiries, decision making, support, and patient education, many limitations still exist when applied in healthcare and medical research. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT is a technology that could greatly assist the diagnostic and treatment process, and although there are existing limitations, the future possibilities give hope for further development. © 2023 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is an advanced language model developed by OpenAI, enabling AI to generate coherent, contextually relevant, and human-like text responses.
