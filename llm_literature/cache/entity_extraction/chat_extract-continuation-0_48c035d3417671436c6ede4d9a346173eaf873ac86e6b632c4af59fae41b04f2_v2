State-of-the-art systems are highly accurate on scientific benchmarks. A lack of explainability is currently a complicating factor in many real-world applications. Comprehensible systems are necessary to prevent biased, counterintuitive, or harmful decisions. We introduce semantic extents, a concept to analyze decision patterns for the relation classification task. Semantic extents are the most influential parts of texts concerning classification decisions. Our definition allows similar procedures to determine semantic extents for humans and models. We provide an annotation tool and a software framework to determine semantic extents for humans and models conveniently and reproducibly. Comparing both reveals that models tend to learn shortcut patterns from data. These patterns are hard to detect with current interpretability methods, such as input reductions. Our approach can help detect and eliminate spurious decision patterns during model development. Semantic extents can increase the reliability and security of natural language processing systems. Semantic extents are an essential step in enabling applications in critical areas like healthcare or finance. Moreover, our work opens new research directions for developing methods to explain deep learning models. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a large pretrained language model that has significantly improved information extraction systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPT is a large pretrained language model that has significantly improved information extraction systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature Switzerland AG is the publisher of the work under exclusive license)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEMANTIC EXTENTS<|>EVENT<|>Semantic extents are a concept introduced to analyze decision patterns for the relation classification task, aiming to increase the reliability and security of natural language processing systems)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>GPT<|>BERT and GPT are both large pretrained language models that have improved information extraction systems<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEMANTIC EXTENTS<|>BERT<|>Semantic extents are used to analyze decision patterns in models like BERT<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEMANTIC EXTENTS<|>GPT<|>Semantic extents are used to analyze decision patterns in models like GPT<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEMANTIC EXTENTS<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>The work on semantic extents is published under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
