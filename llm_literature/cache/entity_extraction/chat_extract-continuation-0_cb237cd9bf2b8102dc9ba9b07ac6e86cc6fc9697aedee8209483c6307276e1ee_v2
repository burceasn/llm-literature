Released by OpenAI in November 2022, ChatGPT rapidly gained global attention. Trained on massive text datasets, this large language model holds immense potential to revolutionize healthcare. However, existing literature often overlooks the need for rigorous validation and real-world applicability. Methods: This head-to-head comparative study assesses ChatGPT’s capabilities in providing therapeutic recommendations for head and neck cancers. Simulating every NCCN Guidelines scenarios. ChatGPT is queried on primary treatments, adjuvant treatment, and follow-up, with responses compared to the NCCN Guidelines. Performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, are employed for assessment. Results: The study includes 68 hypothetical cases and 204 clinical scenarios. ChatGPT exhibits promising capabilities in addressing NCCN-related queries, achieving high sensitivity and overall accuracy across primary treatment, adjuvant treatment, and follow-up. The study's metrics showcase robustness in providing relevant suggestions. However, a few inaccuracies are noted, especially in primary treatment scenarios. Conclusion: Our study highlights the proficiency of ChatGPT in providing treatment suggestions. The model's alignment with the NCCN Guidelines sets the stage for a nuanced exploration of AI's evolving role in oncological decision support. However, challenges related to the interpretability of AI in clinical decision-making and the importance of clinicians understanding the underlying principles of AI models remain unexplored. As AI continues to advance, collaborative efforts between models and medical experts are deemed essential for unlocking new frontiers in personalized cancer care. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, released in November 2022, with potential applications in healthcare, particularly in providing therapeutic recommendations for head and neck cancers based on NCCN Guidelines scenarios.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenAI is the organization that developed and released ChatGPT, a large language model that has gained global attention for its capabilities in natural language processing and machine learning.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NCCN GUIDELINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The NCCN Guidelines are a set of clinical practice guidelines used in oncology to provide evidence-based recommendations for cancer treatment, including head and neck cancers.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH GERMANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany is a publishing organization that holds exclusive rights to the study under discussion, as part of Springer Nature.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature is a global publishing organization that includes Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany and holds exclusive rights to the study.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAD AND NECK CANCERS<|>EVENT<|>Head and neck cancers are the focus of the study, which evaluates ChatGPT's ability to provide therapeutic recommendations based on NCCN Guidelines scenarios.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOVEMBER 2022<|>EVENT<|>November 2022 marks the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI, a significant event in the field of natural language processing and machine learning.)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>OPENAI<|>ChatGPT was developed and released by OpenAI in November 2022.<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>NCCN GUIDELINES<|>ChatGPT's capabilities were assessed in providing therapeutic recommendations for head and neck cancers based on NCCN Guidelines scenarios.<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>HEAD AND NECK CANCERS<|>ChatGPT was evaluated for its ability to provide treatment suggestions for head and neck cancers.<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENAI<|>NOVEMBER 2022<|>OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, marking a significant milestone in AI development.<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH GERMANY<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany is part of Springer Nature, which holds exclusive rights to the study.<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
