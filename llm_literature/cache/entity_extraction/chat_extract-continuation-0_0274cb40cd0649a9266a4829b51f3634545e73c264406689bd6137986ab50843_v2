Despite the recent advances in training large language models for a variety of natural language processing tasks, the developed models and techniques have mainly focused on formal texts and do not perform as well on colloquial data, which is characterized by a number of distinct challenges. In our research, we focus on the healthcare domain and investigate the problem of symptom recognition from colloquial texts by designing and evaluating several training strategies for BERT-based model fine-tuning. These strategies are distinguished by the choice of the base model, the training corpora, and application of term perturbations in the training data. The best-performing models trained using these strategies outperform the state-of-the-art specialized symptom recognizer by a large margin. Through a series of experiments, we have found specific patterns of model behavior associated with the training strategies we designed. We present design principles for training strategies for effective entity recognition in colloquial texts based on our findings. © 2023\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BERT-BASED MODEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of model used in natural language processing tasks, specifically fine-tuned for symptom recognition in colloquial texts in the healthcare domain)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCARE DOMAIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A domain of application for decision support systems, focusing on symptom recognition from colloquial texts)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYMPTOM RECOGNIZER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specialized tool or model designed to identify symptoms from colloquial texts, outperformed by the best-performing models in the research)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>EVENT<|>A field of study focused on enabling machines to understand and process human language, particularly in formal and colloquial texts)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Systems designed to assist in decision-making processes, particularly in domains like healthcare and customer relationship management)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT-BASED MODEL<|>HEALTHCARE DOMAIN<|>The BERT-based model is fine-tuned for symptom recognition in the healthcare domain<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT-BASED MODEL<|>SYMPTOM RECOGNIZER<|>The BERT-based model outperforms the state-of-the-art symptom recognizer<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTHCARE DOMAIN<|>DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS<|>The healthcare domain is one of the applications for decision support systems<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS<|>Natural language processing is a key capability for decision support systems<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
