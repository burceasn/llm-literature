Since its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT has been making waves in diverse areas ranging from customer care to healthcare, education to automobiles, and the financial world to communication technology. This study presents the theoretical background, use of technology, and its applications in various business areas. The study aims to organize much talked about but less understood technological aspects from a modern technological disruption perspective and lays the agenda for multidisciplinary research. Furthermore, we present AI-powered chatbot applications and business use cases vis-à-vis the uncertainties of using technology. Finally, we conclude by stating our thoughts regarding the direction of technology so that ChatGPT could benefit the business world. © 2023 The Chinese Economic Association–UK.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OPENAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenAI is the organization that developed and launched ChatGPT, a text-based artificial intelligence tool, in November 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is an AI-powered natural language processing tool developed by OpenAI, widely used in various industries such as customer care, healthcare, education, and finance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CHINESE ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION–UK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese Economic Association–UK is the organization that published the study discussing ChatGPT's applications and technological impact)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENAI<|>CHATGPT<|>OpenAI developed and launched ChatGPT, an AI-powered tool<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>THE CHINESE ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION–UK<|>The Chinese Economic Association–UK published a study discussing ChatGPT's applications and impact<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
