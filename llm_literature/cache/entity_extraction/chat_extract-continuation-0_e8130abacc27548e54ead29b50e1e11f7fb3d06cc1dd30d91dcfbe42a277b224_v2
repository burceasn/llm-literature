Utilizing a specialized dataset extracted from Wikipedia articles, transformer models, namely Bert-base-cased, Electra-base, Deberta-base, Xlm-roberta-base, Distilbert-base, and Albert-base, were scrutinized based on their F1 scores and exact match accuracy. Electra-base and Deberta-base exhibited notable performance, showcasing the significance of models equipped with denoising mechanisms and disentangled attention. The outcomes highlight the critical role of tailored model selection in specific domains, particularly within health-related contexts. Future research avenues may explore fine-tuning strategies and optimizations for health datasets, addressing challenges in medical information extraction and question-answering. This study contributes valuable insights to the natural language processing field, guiding advancements in transformer-based question-answering systems, especially in the health domain.  © 2024 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BERT-BASE-CASED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bert-base-cased is a transformer-based model evaluated for its performance in question-answering systems, particularly in health-related contexts)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRA-BASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electra-base is a transformer-based model that exhibited notable performance in health-related question-answering systems due to its denoising mechanisms)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEBERTA-BASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deberta-base is a transformer-based model that showed significant performance in health-related question-answering systems, leveraging disentangled attention mechanisms)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XLM-ROBERTA-BASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Xlm-roberta-base is a transformer-based model analyzed for its effectiveness in health-related question-answering systems)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISTILBERT-BASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Distilbert-base is a transformer-based model evaluated for its performance in health-related question-answering systems)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALBERT-BASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Albert-base is a transformer-based model scrutinized for its performance in health-related question-answering systems)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IEEE is the organization that published the study on transformer-based models for health-related question-answering systems)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT-BASE-CASED<|>ELECTRA-BASE<|>Both Bert-base-cased and Electra-base are transformer-based models evaluated for their performance in health-related question-answering systems<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELECTRA-BASE<|>DEBERTA-BASE<|>Electra-base and Deberta-base are transformer-based models that exhibited notable performance in health-related question-answering systems<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XLM-ROBERTA-BASE<|>DISTILBERT-BASE<|>Xlm-roberta-base and Distilbert-base are transformer-based models analyzed for their effectiveness in health-related question-answering systems<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBERT-BASE<|>IEEE<|>Albert-base is a transformer-based model evaluated in a study published by IEEE<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
