The scarcity of adverse event annotations and underlying semantic ambiguities make accurate scope identification challenging. The current research explores integrating contextualized language models and multi-task learning from diverse clinical NER datasets to mitigate this challenge. We propose a novel multi-task adaptation method to refine the embeddings generated by the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language model to improve inter-task knowledge sharing. We integrated the adapted BERT model into a unique hierarchical multi-task neural network comprised of the medication and auxiliary clinical NER tasks. We validated the model using two different versions of BERT on diverse well-studied clinical tasks: Medication and ADE (n2c2 2018/n2c2 2009), Clinical Concepts (n2c2 2010/n2c2 2012), Disorders (ShAReCLEF 2013). Overall medication extraction performance enhanced by up to +1.19 F1 (n2c2 2018) while generalization enhanced by +5.38 F1 (n2c2 2009) as compared to standalone BERT baselines. ADE recognition enhanced significantly (McNemar's test), out-performing prior baselines. Similar benefits were observed on the auxiliary clinical and disorder tasks. We demonstrate that combining multi-dataset BERT adaptation and multi-task learning out-performs prior medication extraction methods without requiring additional features, newer training data, or ensembling. Taken together, the study contributes an initial case study towards integrating diverse clinical datasets in an end-to-end NER model for clinical decision support. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
