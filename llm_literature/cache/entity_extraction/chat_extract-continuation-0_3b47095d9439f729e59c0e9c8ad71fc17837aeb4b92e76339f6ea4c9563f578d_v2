Using various databases, 103 relevant articles were retrieved and analyzed through scientometric, quantitative, and application-based approaches. A Google trend analysis and comparison with other generative AI and chatbot technologies were also carried out. The study provides insights into the distribution of ChatGPT publications across different countries and regions, the network of co-occurring keywords, authorship analysis, article typology, and publishing entities. The findings offer a comprehensive overview of the current state of ChatGPT research, highlighting key directions for future research. The study finds that ChatGPT has gained significant attention and interest in online platforms, particularly in technology, education, and healthcare, and highlights potential ethical and legal concerns related to its use. Its applications extend to several literary and text generation areas. We do note that the sample of extracted publications is lower than anticipated due to the niche area of investigation. The article is relevant to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in the field of AI-powered language models, especially ChatGPT.  © 2013 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a conversational AI technology developed by OpenAI, gaining significant attention in technology, education, and healthcare, with applications in literary and text generation areas)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenAI is the organization that developed ChatGPT, a conversational AI technology)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IEEE is the publishing entity of the article analyzing ChatGPT research)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google is referenced for trend analysis in the study of ChatGPT research)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>OPENAI<|>OpenAI developed ChatGPT, a conversational AI technology<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>IEEE<|>The article analyzing ChatGPT research was published by IEEE<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>GOOGLE<|>Google trend analysis was used to study ChatGPT's online attention and interest<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
