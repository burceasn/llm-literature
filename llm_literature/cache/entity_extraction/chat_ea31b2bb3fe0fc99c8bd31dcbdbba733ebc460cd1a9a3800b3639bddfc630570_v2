Existing studies have discovered that patients’ functional status is a strong predictor of health outcomes, particularly in older adults. Depite their usefulness, much of the functional status information is stored in electronic health records (EHRs) in either semi-structured or free text formats. This indicates the pressing need to leverage computational approaches such as natural language processing (NLP) to accelerate the curation of functional status information. In this study, we introduced FedFSA, a hybrid and federated NLP framework designed to extract functional status information from EHRs across multiple healthcare institutions. Methods: FedFSA consists of four major components: 1) individual sites (clients) with their private local data, 2) a rule-based information extraction (IE) framework for ADL extraction, 3) a BERT model for functional status impairment classification, and 4) a concept normalizer. The framework was implemented using the OHNLP Backbone for rule-based IE and open-source Flower and PyTorch library for federated BERT components. For gold standard data generation, we carried out corpus annotation to identify functional status-related expressions based on ICF definitions. Four healthcare institutions were included in the study. To assess FedFSA, we evaluated the performance of category- and institution-specific ADL extraction across different experimental designs. Results: ADL extraction performance ranges from an F1-score of 0.907 to 0.986 for bADL and 0.825 to 0.951 for iADL across the four healthcare sites. The performance for ADL extraction with impairment ranges from an F1-score of 0.722 to 0.954 for bADL and 0.674 to 0.813 for iADL across four healthcare sites. For category-specific ADL extraction, laundry and transferring yielded relatively high performance, while dressing, medication, bathing, and continence achieved moderate-high performance. Conversely, food preparation and toileting showed low performance. Conclusion: NLP performance varied across ADL categories and healthcare sites. Federated learning using a FedFSA framework performed higher than non-federated learning for impaired ADL extraction at all healthcare sites. Our study demonstrated the potential of the federated learning framework in functional status extraction and impairment classification in EHRs, exemplifying the importance of a large-scale, multi-institutional collaborative development effort. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
