Our study investigates the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the assessment criteria and risk factors from the guidelines for future analysis against medical records in EHR. Materials and Methods: We annotated the criteria, risk factors, and preventive medical services described in the adult guidelines published by United States Preventive Services Taskforce and evaluated 3 state-of-the-art LLMs on extracting information in these categories from the guidelines automatically. Results: We included 24 guidelines in this study. The LLMs can automate the extraction of all criteria, risk factors, and medical services from 9 guidelines. All 3 LLMs perform well on extracting information regarding the demographic criteria or risk factors. Some LLMs perform better on extracting the social determinants of health, family history, and preventive counseling services than the others. Discussion: While LLMs demonstrate the capability to handle lengthy preventive care guidelines, several challenges persist, including constraints related to the maximum length of input tokens and the tendency to generate content rather than adhering strictly to the original input. Moreover, the utilization of LLMs in real-world clinical settings necessitates careful ethical consideration. It is imperative that healthcare professionals meticulously validate the extracted information to mitigate biases, ensure completeness, and maintain accuracy. Conclusion: We developed a data structure to store the annotated preventive guidelines and make it publicly available. Employing state-of-the-art LLMs to extract preventive care criteria, risk factors, and preventive care services paves the way for the future integration of these guidelines into the EHR.  © The Author(s) 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are systems used to store and manage patient health information, integrated with preventive guidelines for improved healthcare outcomes)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems used to automate the extraction of criteria, risk factors, and preventive medical services from healthcare guidelines)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASKFORCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United States Preventive Services Taskforce publishes adult guidelines containing criteria, risk factors, and preventive medical services used in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS<|>PERSON<|>Healthcare professionals are responsible for validating extracted information from LLMs to ensure accuracy, completeness, and mitigate biases in clinical settings)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S) 2024<|>PERSON<|>The author(s) of the study published in 2024, responsible for developing the data structure and making annotated preventive guidelines publicly available)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>LLMs are used to automate the extraction of preventive care criteria and risk factors for integration into EHRs<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>UNITED STATES PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASKFORCE<|>LLMs are evaluated on their ability to extract information from guidelines published by the United States Preventive Services Taskforce<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>Healthcare professionals must validate the information extracted by LLMs to ensure accuracy and mitigate biases<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S) 2024<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>The author(s) developed a data structure to store annotated guidelines and evaluated LLMs for extracting preventive care information<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
