Technological advancements have introduced large language models such as Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), powered by artificial intelligence (AI), which has already shown promise in revolutionizing medical writing. This study aimed to conduct a detailed evaluation of ChatGPT-3.5's role in enhancing various aspects of medical writing. From May 10 to 12, 2023, the authors engaged in a series of interactions with ChatGPT-3.5 to evaluate its effectiveness in various tasks, particularly its application to medical writing, including vocabulary enhancement, text rewriting for plagiarism prevention, hypothesis generation, keyword generation, title generation, article summarization, simplification of medical jargon, transforming text from informal to scientific and data interpretation. The exploration of ChatGPT's functionalities in medical writing revealed its potential in enhancing various aspects of the writing process, demonstrating its efficiency in improving vocabulary usage, suggesting alternative phrasing, and providing grammar enhancements. While the results indicate the effectiveness of ChatGPT (version 3.5), the presence of certain imperfections highlights the current indispensability of human intervention to refine and validate outputs, ensuring accuracy and relevance in medical settings. The integration of AI into medical writing shows significant potential for improving clarity, efficiency, and reliability. This evaluation highlights both the benefits and limitations of using ChatGPT-3.5, emphasizing its ability to enhance vocabulary, prevent plagiarism, generate hypotheses, suggest keywords, summarize articles, simplify medical jargon, and transform informal text into an academic format. However, AI tools should not replace human expertise. It is crucial for medical professionals to ensure thorough human review and validation to maintain the accuracy and relevance of the content in case they eventually use AI as a supplementary resource in medical writing. Accepting this mutually symbiotic partnership holds the promise of improving medical research and patient outcomes, and it sets the stage for the fusion of AI and human knowledge to produce a novel approach to medical assessment. Thus, while AI can streamline certain tasks, experienced medical writers and researchers must perform final reviews to uphold high standards in medical communications. © 2024 the Author(s).
