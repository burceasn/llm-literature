Identifying the scientific literature related to DILI is crucial for monitoring, investigating, and conducting meta-analyses of drug safety issues. Given the intricate and often obscure nature of drug interactions, simple keyword searching can be insufficient for the exhaustive retrieval of the DILI-relevant literature. Manual curation of DILI-related publications demands pharmaceutical expertise and is susceptible to errors, severely limiting throughput. Despite numerous efforts utilizing cutting-edge natural language processing and deep learning techniques to automatically identify the DILI-related literature, their performance remains suboptimal for real-world applications in clinical research and regulatory contexts. In the past year, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and its open-source counterpart LLaMA have achieved groundbreaking progress in natural language understanding and question answering, paving the way for the automated, high-throughput identification of the DILI-related literature and subsequent analysis. Leveraging a large-scale public dataset comprising 14 203 training publications from the CAMDA 2022 literature AI challenge, we have developed what we believe to be the first LLM specialized in DILI analysis based on LLaMA-2. In comparison with other smaller language models such as BERT, GPT, and their variants, LLaMA-2 exhibits an enhanced out-of-fold accuracy of 97.19% and area under the ROC curve of 0.9947 using 3-fold cross-validation on the training set. Despite LLMs’ initial design for dialogue systems, our study illustrates their successful adaptation into accurate classifiers for automated identification of the DILI-related literature from vast collections of documents. This work is a step toward unleashing the potential of LLMs in the context of regulatory science and facilitating the regulatory review process. © 2024 American Chemical Society.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DRUG-INDUCED LIVER INJURY (DILI)<|>EVENT<|>Drug-induced liver injury is a significant concern in drug safety and the primary cause of acute liver failure, requiring extensive monitoring and investigation in pharmaceutical research)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, achieving groundbreaking progress in natural language understanding and question answering)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LLAMA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LLaMA is an open-source large language model that has made significant advancements in natural language understanding and has been adapted for specialized tasks like DILI analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LLAMA-2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LLaMA-2 is a specialized version of the LLaMA model, achieving high accuracy in identifying DILI-related literature and demonstrating enhanced performance in regulatory science applications)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAMDA 2022<|>EVENT<|>CAMDA 2022 is a literature AI challenge that provided a large-scale public dataset of 14,203 training publications used to develop specialized models for DILI analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The American Chemical Society is a scientific organization that published the study on leveraging LLMs for DILI-related literature identification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a smaller language model used as a benchmark in comparison with LLaMA-2 for DILI-related literature identification)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPT is a language model used as a benchmark in comparison with LLaMA-2 for DILI-related literature identification)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>LLAMA<|>Both ChatGPT and LLaMA are large language models that have achieved significant progress in natural language understanding<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLAMA-2<|>LLAMA<|>LLaMA-2 is a specialized version of the LLaMA model, adapted for DILI-related literature analysis<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLAMA-2<|>CAMDA 2022<|>LLaMA-2 was developed using the dataset from the CAMDA 2022 literature AI challenge<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLAMA-2<|>BERT<|>LLaMA-2 outperformed BERT in accuracy and performance for DILI-related literature identification<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLAMA-2<|>GPT<|>LLaMA-2 outperformed GPT in accuracy and performance for DILI-related literature identification<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRUG-INDUCED LIVER INJURY (DILI)<|>LLAMA-2<|>LLaMA-2 was developed to identify and analyze DILI-related literature<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRUG-INDUCED LIVER INJURY (DILI)<|>AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY<|>The American Chemical Society published the study on leveraging LLMs for DILI-related literature identification<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
