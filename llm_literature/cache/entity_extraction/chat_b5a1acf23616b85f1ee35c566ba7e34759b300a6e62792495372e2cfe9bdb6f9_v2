Despite multifaceted efforts to tackle ABR, complex challenges persist across scientific, economic, behavioral, ethical, and legal dimensions. Artificial intelligence (AI), which encompasses machine capabilities for human-like tasks, offers a wide range of applications in healthcare. Chatbots, a subtype of AI, emerge as a powerful avenue for natural language interaction with users. In healthcare, chatbots have demonstrated value in symptom assessment, mental health support, medication adherence, and patient engagement. In this context, our article will comprehensively examine the opportunities and challenges presented by chatbots in bacterial disease management and ABR mitigation. We will delve into not only the technical considerations but also the ethical, legal, and social complexities accompanying their integration into healthcare. The current consideration will be valuable for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers as they navigate the dynamic intersection of chatbots and the pressing issue of antibiotic resistance.
