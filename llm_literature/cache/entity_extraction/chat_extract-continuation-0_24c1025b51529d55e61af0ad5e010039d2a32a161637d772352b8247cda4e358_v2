However, there has been less focus on isolating and understanding patient primary concerns in PPMs-a practice which holds the potential to yield more nuanced insights and enhances the quality of healthcare delivery and patient-centered care. Materials and Methods: We propose a fusion framework to leverage pretrained language models (LMs) with different language advantages via a Convolution Neural Network for precise identification of patient primary concerns via multi-class classification. We examined 3 traditional machine learning models, 9 BERT-based language models, 6 fusion models, and 2 ensemble models. Results: The outcomes of our experimentation underscore the superior performance achieved by BERT-based models in comparison to traditional machine learning models. Remarkably, our fusion model emerges as the top-performing solution, delivering a notably improved accuracy score of 77.67 ± 2.74% and an F1 score of 74.37 ± 3.70% in macro-average. Discussion: This study highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of multi-class classification for patient primary concern detection and the proposed fusion framework for enhancing primary concern detection. Conclusions: The use of multi-class classification enhanced by a fusion of multiple pretrained LMs not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of patient primary concern identification in PPMs but also aids in managing the rising volume of PPMs in healthcare, ensuring critical patient communications are addressed promptly and accurately.  © The Author(s) 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PATIENT PORTAL MESSAGES (PPMS)<|>EVENT<|>The surge in patient portal messages (PPMs) has increased the need for efficient triage in healthcare settings, prompting the exploration of AI-driven solutions to streamline healthcare workflows and ensure timely responses to patients.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AI-DRIVEN SOLUTIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI-driven solutions are being explored to streamline healthcare workflow processes and improve the efficiency of handling patient portal messages (PPMs).)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Convolution Neural Network is part of the proposed fusion framework to leverage pretrained language models for precise identification of patient primary concerns.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT-BASED LANGUAGE MODELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT-based language models are examined in the study and demonstrate superior performance in identifying patient primary concerns compared to traditional machine learning models.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUSION MODEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The fusion model is the top-performing solution in the study, achieving improved accuracy and F1 scores for patient primary concern detection.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING MODELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Traditional machine learning models are compared to BERT-based models in the study, with the latter showing superior performance.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENSEMBLE MODELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ensemble models are part of the study's experimentation, contributing to the evaluation of patient primary concern detection.)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATIENT PORTAL MESSAGES (PPMS)<|>AI-DRIVEN SOLUTIONS<|>AI-driven solutions are being explored to address the surge in patient portal messages (PPMs) and improve healthcare workflow efficiency.<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK<|>BERT-BASED LANGUAGE MODELS<|>The Convolution Neural Network is used in a fusion framework with BERT-based language models to enhance patient primary concern detection.<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUSION MODEL<|>BERT-BASED LANGUAGE MODELS<|>The fusion model leverages BERT-based language models to achieve superior performance in patient primary concern detection.<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING MODELS<|>BERT-BASED LANGUAGE MODELS<|>BERT-based language models outperform traditional machine learning models in identifying patient primary concerns.<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENSEMBLE MODELS<|>FUSION MODEL<|>Ensemble models are part of the study's experimentation, contributing to the evaluation of the fusion model's performance.<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
