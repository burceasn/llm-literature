This paper explores the extensive applications of LLMs in the medical domain, examining their impact on healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. Furthermore, the paper delves into their role in natural language processing, data analysis, decision support, and ethical considerations, highlighting the potential benefits they pose. Through a systematic review of recent literature and case studies, an exhaustive overview of the transformative potential of LLMs in medicine is presented. Furthermore, an experiment was performed using ChatGPT Plus showcasing the capabilities of the generative artificial intelligence to process medical information and to provide valuable output and formulate relevant conclusions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems that have revolutionized the field of medicine by enhancing research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care through natural language processing and data analysis capabilities)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT PLUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT Plus is a generative artificial intelligence tool used in an experiment to process medical information and provide valuable insights and conclusions)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature Switzerland AG is the publisher of the paper under exclusive license, which explores the applications of LLMs in medicine)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>PERSON<|>The author(s) of the paper conducted a systematic review and experiment to explore the transformative potential of LLMs in medicine)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>CHATGPT PLUS<|>ChatGPT Plus is an example of a Large Language Model used in the experiment to demonstrate its capabilities in processing medical information<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>The author(s) conducted a systematic review and experiment to explore the applications and impact of LLMs in medicine<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>The author(s) published their findings under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
