The purpose of this narrative review is to present the perspectives of ChatGPT in Pharmacology and Medical Education. And highlight the limitations of ChatGPT in these areas and draw the attention of policymakers in healthcare to implement such technologies while taking into consideration ethical issues. To collect information regarding the perspectives of ChatGPT in pharmacology and medical education. And highlight the limitations of ChatGPT in these areas. In health care, it helps in the drug discovery and development process, diagnosis, treatment, counseling, assisting in surgical procedures, pharmacovigilance, pharmacy, and so on. In medical education, this tool plays a crucial role in online tutoring, personalized assistance, grading, improvement in grammar, and so on. Despite the limitations, ChatGPT is helpful in healthcare, medical education, and scientific writing. To overcome such limitations of ChatGPT, like ethical issues, emotionlessness, providing information before 2021, the risk of biases, uncontrollability, lack of transparency, academic dishonesty, and so on, alternatives have been developed, but they also fail to entirely resolve the associated limitations. Looking at the current scenarios, there is an urgent need for comprehensive guidelines to address these limitations and provide a framework for appropriately utilizing AI tools in healthcare domains. This framework should also focus on maintaining a balance between human involvement and technological advancements. © The Author(s) 2023.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a large language model tool used in various fields such as healthcare, medical education, agriculture, and customer support for tasks like information retrieval, generating human-like conversations, and natural language processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPEN AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Open AI is the organization behind the development of advanced artificial intelligence technologies, including ChatGPT)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHARMACOLOGY<|>EVENT<|>Pharmacology is a field where ChatGPT is being utilized for drug discovery, development, diagnosis, treatment, and pharmacovigilance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDICAL EDUCATION<|>EVENT<|>Medical Education is a field where ChatGPT is used for online tutoring, personalized assistance, grading, and improving grammar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCARE<|>EVENT<|>Healthcare is a domain where ChatGPT assists in various tasks such as diagnosis, treatment, counseling, and surgical procedures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCIENTIFIC WRITING<|>EVENT<|>Scientific Writing is an area where ChatGPT is utilized despite its limitations)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>OPEN AI<|>ChatGPT is a product developed by Open AI<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>PHARMACOLOGY<|>ChatGPT is used in Pharmacology for drug discovery, development, and pharmacovigilance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>MEDICAL EDUCATION<|>ChatGPT plays a crucial role in Medical Education for online tutoring, personalized assistance, and grading<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>HEALTHCARE<|>ChatGPT assists in Healthcare for tasks like diagnosis, treatment, and surgical procedures<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>SCIENTIFIC WRITING<|>ChatGPT is used in Scientific Writing despite its limitations<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
