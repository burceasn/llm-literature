Manual creation of patient summary is repetitive, time-consuming, prone to errors, and increases clinicians’ workload. AI, through voice recognition and Natural Language Processing (NLP), can automate this task more accurately and efficiently. Erectile dysfunction (ED) clinics, which deal with specific pattern of conditions together with an involvement of broader systemic issues, can greatly benefit from AI-driven patient summary. This scoping review examined the evidence on AI-generated patient summary and evaluated their implementation in ED clinics. Recent Findings: A total of 381 articles were initially identified, 11 studies were included for the analysis. These studies showcased various methodologies, such as AI-assisted clinical notes and NLP algorithms. Most studies have demonstrated the ability of AI to be used in real life clinical scenarios. Major electronic health record platforms are also integrating AI to their system. However, to date, no studies have specifically addressed AI for patient summary creation in ED clinics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI is a technology that has revolutionized clinical practices, particularly in data management and patient visit summary creation, through voice recognition and Natural Language Processing (NLP).)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NLP is a subset of AI that enables the automation of tasks like patient summary creation through voice recognition and text analysis.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION CLINICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ED clinics deal with specific conditions and systemic issues, and can benefit from AI-driven patient summary creation.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Science+Business Media is the publisher of the article under exclusive licence, part of Springer Nature 2024.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature is the parent organization of Springer Science+Business Media, which published the article.)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>NLP is a subset of AI used for automating tasks like patient summary creation<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION CLINICS<|>AI is being evaluated for its potential to improve patient summary creation in ED clinics<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>Springer Science+Business Media is part of Springer Nature<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
