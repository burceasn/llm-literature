In this context, the upcoming digital transformation should strive to support orthopedic surgeons and trauma surgeons in delivering individualized and optimized patient care. Chatbots, technical dialogue systems that enable human interactions with computer-based programs via spoken or written language, are already increasingly being utilized in patient care, propelled by recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). This article discusses the potential and the challenges associated with the use of chatbots throughout the orthopedic treatment pathway of patients, particularly aiming to provide optimal preoperative, perioperative and rehabilitative care to enhance treatment outcomes. In addition to the technology, where a distinction is made between rule-based and AI-driven models, applications in sports orthopedics are analyzed from the initial contact to postoperative care using examples from the current literature. Challenges include liability, data protection, regulatory guidelines and implementation tasks. With the ongoing digitalization in the healthcare system chatbots could potentially be an instrumental tool in positively impacting aspects of the diagnostics, postoperative care, and patient education in orthopedics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GERMAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The German healthcare system is facing challenges such as health economic constraints, staff shortages, and resource limitations, particularly in orthopedics)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS<|>PERSON<|>Orthopedic surgeons are medical professionals who deliver individualized and optimized patient care, particularly in the context of digital transformation)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAUMA SURGEONS<|>PERSON<|>Trauma surgeons are medical professionals involved in patient care, particularly in the context of digital transformation)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATBOTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chatbots are technical dialogue systems that enable human interactions with computer-based programs, increasingly used in patient care due to advancements in AI)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER MEDIZIN VERLAG GMBH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH is a part of Springer Nature and holds exclusive rights to the article discussing chatbots in orthopedics)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature is the parent organization of Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, which holds exclusive rights to the article)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORTHOPEDIC TREATMENT PATHWAY<|>EVENT<|>The orthopedic treatment pathway refers to the process of patient care in orthopedics, including preoperative, perioperative, and rehabilitative care)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPORTS ORTHOPEDICS<|>EVENT<|>Sports orthopedics is a specialized area of orthopedics that focuses on the treatment of sports-related injuries and conditions)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERMAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM<|>ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS<|>Orthopedic surgeons operate within the German healthcare system, which is facing challenges that impact their work<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERMAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM<|>TRAUMA SURGEONS<|>Trauma surgeons operate within the German healthcare system, which is facing challenges that impact their work<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATBOTS<|>ORTHOPEDIC TREATMENT PATHWAY<|>Chatbots are being utilized to enhance the orthopedic treatment pathway, particularly in preoperative, perioperative, and rehabilitative care<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATBOTS<|>SPORTS ORTHOPEDICS<|>Chatbots are analyzed for their applications in sports orthopedics, from initial contact to postoperative care<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINGER MEDIZIN VERLAG GMBH<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH is a part of Springer Nature<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
