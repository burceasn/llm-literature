The goal of BioNER is to extract essential information, such as genes, proteins, diseases, drugs, et al., from scientific literature, electronic health records (EHRs), biomedical databases, and other biomedical text sources. The recognition and classification of these entities are crucial for various biomedical and healthcare-related tasks, including information retrieval, data integration, knowledge extraction, and drug discovery. Traditional BioNER methods typically involve rule-based approaches or machine learning algorithms, et al. These methods have been widely used before the advent of deep learning and transformer-based models. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a groundbreaking transformer-based language model. It has revolutionized various natural language processing (NLP) tasks by capturing contextual information and obtain optimal results in multiple benchmarks. A lightweight BioNER optimized model from traditional BERT (LWNER) is proposed in this study, which can capture contextual information and its knowledge transfer from pre-training on large-scale text corpora without relying heavily on feature engineering and handcrafted rules. Fine-tuning BERT on biomedical-specific data helps adapt the model to the nuances and terminology of the biomedical domain. We conduct the method LWNER on BioCreative dataset, BC2GM, BC4CHEMD, BC5CDR, especially the chemical entity in BC5CDR achieve F1- score 91.3%. We construct an online web tool based on LWNER to identify the arbitrary text from scientific literatures for building knowledge graph.  © 2023 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIOMEDICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (BIONER)<|>EVENT<|>A specialized subfield of Named Entity Recognition (NER) that focuses on identifying and classifying named entities in biomedical and clinical texts, crucial for tasks like information retrieval, data integration, and drug discovery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER)<|>EVENT<|>A broader field of natural language processing that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text, with BioNER being a specialized subfield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A groundbreaking transformer-based language model that has revolutionized various natural language processing tasks by capturing contextual information)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LWNER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A lightweight BioNER optimized model derived from BERT, designed to capture contextual information and knowledge transfer from pre-training on large-scale text corpora without heavy reliance on feature engineering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOCREATIVE DATASET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A dataset used in the evaluation of the LWNER model, specifically including BC2GM, BC4CHEMD, and BC5CDR, with BC5CDR achieving an F1-score of 91.3% for chemical entity recognition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BC2GM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A dataset used in the evaluation of the LWNER model, part of the BioCreative dataset)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BC4CHEMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A dataset used in the evaluation of the LWNER model, part of the BioCreative dataset)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BC5CDR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A dataset used in the evaluation of the LWNER model, part of the BioCreative dataset, achieving an F1-score of 91.3% for chemical entity recognition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization that published the study, as indicated by the copyright notice)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOMEDICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (BIONER)<|>NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER)<|>BioNER is a specialized subfield of NER, focusing on biomedical and clinical texts<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT)<|>LWNER<|>LWNER is a lightweight BioNER optimized model derived from BERT, designed to improve performance in biomedical text processing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LWNER<|>BIOCREATIVE DATASET<|>LWNER was evaluated using the BioCreative dataset, including BC2GM, BC4CHEMD, and BC5CDR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BC2GM<|>BIOCREATIVE DATASET<|>BC2GM is a component of the BioCreative dataset used in the evaluation of LWNER<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BC4CHEMD<|>BIOCREATIVE DATASET<|>BC4CHEMD is a component of the BioCreative dataset used in the evaluation of LWNER<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BC5CDR<|>BIOCREATIVE DATASET<|>BC5CDR is a component of the BioCreative dataset used in the evaluation of LWNER, achieving an F1-score of 91.3% for chemical entity recognition<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LWNER<|>IEEE<|>The study proposing LWNER was published by IEEE, as indicated by the copyright notice<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
