The prioritization of patient queries containing medically severe text is necessary to optimize resource usage and provide care to those with time-sensitive needs. Objective: We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning solutions on the task of telemedical triage and provide a thorough error analysis, identifying telemedical queries that challenge state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) systems. Additionally, we aim to provide a publicly available telemedical query data set with labels for severity classification for telemedical triage of respiratory issues. Methods: We annotated 573 medical queries from 3 online health platforms: HealthTap, HealthcareMagic, and iCliniq. We then evaluated 6 transfer learning solutions utilizing various text-embedding strategies. Specifically, we first established a baseline using a lexical classification model with term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) features. Next, we investigated the effectiveness of global vectors for text representation (GloVe), a pretrained word-embedding method. We evaluated the performance of GloVe embeddings in the context of support vector machines (SVMs), bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) networks, and hierarchical attention networks (HANs). Finally, we evaluated the performance of contextual text embeddings using transformer-based architectures. Specifically, we evaluated bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT), Bio+Clinical-BERT, and Sentence-BERT (SBERT) on the telemedical triage task. Results: We found that a simple lexical model achieved a mean F1 score of 0.865 (SD 0.048) on the telemedical triage task. GloVe-based models using SVMs, HANs, and bi-LSTMs achieved a 0.8-, 1.5-, and 2.1-point increase in the F1 score, respectively. Transformer-based models, such as BERT, Bio+Clinical-BERT, and SBERT, achieved a mean F1 score of 0.914 (SD 0.034), 0.904 (SD 0.041), and 0.917 (SD 0.037), respectively. The highest-performing model, SBERT, provided a statistically significant improvement compared to all GloVe-based and lexical baselines. However, no statistical significance was found when comparing transformer-based models. Furthermore, our error analysis revealed highly challenging query types, including those with complex negations, temporal relationships, and patient intents. Conclusions: We showed that state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques work well on the telemedical triage task, providing significant performance increase over lexical models. Additionally, we released a public telemedical triage data set using labeled questions from online medical question-and-answer (Q&A) platforms. Our analysis highlights various avenues for future works that explicitly model such query challenges. ©Joseph Gatto, Parker Seegmiller, Garrett Johnston, Sarah Masud Preum.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHTAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HealthTap is an online health platform from which medical queries were annotated for the telemedical triage study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCAREMAGIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HealthcareMagic is an online health platform from which medical queries were annotated for the telemedical triage study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICLINIQ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>iCliniq is an online health platform from which medical queries were annotated for the telemedical triage study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOSEPH GATTO<|>PERSON<|>Joseph Gatto is one of the authors of the study on telemedical triage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARKER SEEGMILLER<|>PERSON<|>Parker Seegmiller is one of the authors of the study on telemedical triage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARRETT JOHNSTON<|>PERSON<|>Garrett Johnston is one of the authors of the study on telemedical triage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAH MASUD PREUM<|>PERSON<|>Sarah Masud Preum is one of the authors of the study on telemedical triage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE STUDY<|>EVENT<|>The telemedical triage study evaluated the effectiveness of transfer learning solutions for prioritizing patient queries with medically severe text)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOSEPH GATTO<|>TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE STUDY<|>Joseph Gatto is an author of the telemedical triage study<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARKER SEEGMILLER<|>TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE STUDY<|>Parker Seegmiller is an author of the telemedical triage study<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GARRETT JOHNSTON<|>TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE STUDY<|>Garrett Johnston is an author of the telemedical triage study<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SARAH MASUD PREUM<|>TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE STUDY<|>Sarah Masud Preum is an author of the telemedical triage study<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTHTAP<|>TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE STUDY<|>HealthTap provided medical queries for the telemedical triage study<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTHCAREMAGIC<|>TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE STUDY<|>HealthcareMagic provided medical queries for the telemedical triage study<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ICLINIQ<|>TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE STUDY<|>iCliniq provided medical queries for the telemedical triage study<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
