This study assesses the performance of two LLMs, the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, in passing the MIR medical examination for access to medical specialist training in Spain. Our objectives included gauging the model’s overall performance, analyzing discrepancies across different medical specialties, discerning between theoretical and practical questions, estimating error proportions, and assessing the hypothetical severity of errors committed by a physician. Material and methods: We studied the 2022 Spanish MIR examination results after excluding those questions requiring image evaluations or having acknowledged errors. The remaining 182 questions were presented to the LLM GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in Spanish and English. Logistic regression models analyzed the relationships between question length, sequence, and performance. We also analyzed the 23 questions with images, using GPT-4’s new image analysis capability. Results: GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, scoring 86.81% in Spanish (p < 0.001). English translations had a slightly enhanced performance. GPT-4 scored 26.1% of the questions with images in English. The results were worse when the questions were in Spanish, 13.0%, although the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.250). Among medical specialties, GPT-4 achieved a 100% correct response rate in several areas, and the Pharmacology, Critical Care, and Infectious Diseases specialties showed lower performance. The error analysis revealed that while a 13.2% error rate existed, the gravest categories, such as “error requiring intervention to sustain life” and “error resulting in death”, had a 0% rate. Conclusions: GPT-4 performs robustly on the Spanish MIR examination, with varying capabilities to discriminate knowledge across specialties. While the model’s high success rate is commendable, understanding the error severity is critical, especially when considering AI’s potential role in real-world medical practice and its implications for patient safety. © 2023 by the authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GPT-3.5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPT-3.5 is a large language model developed by OpenAI, used in this study to assess performance on the Spanish MIR medical examination)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT-4<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPT-4 is a large language model developed by OpenAI, evaluated in this study for its performance on the Spanish MIR medical examination, including image analysis capabilities)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIR MEDICAL EXAMINATION<|>EVENT<|>The MIR medical examination is a test for access to medical specialist training in Spain, used in this study to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPAIN<|>GEO<|>Spain is the country where the MIR medical examination is conducted and where this study was focused)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHARMACOLOGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pharmacology is one of the medical specialties in which GPT-4's performance was analyzed in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRITICAL CARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Critical Care is one of the medical specialties in which GPT-4's performance was analyzed in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Infectious Diseases is one of the medical specialties in which GPT-4's performance was analyzed in the study)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-3.5<|>MIR MEDICAL EXAMINATION<|>GPT-3.5 was evaluated on its performance in the MIR medical examination<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-4<|>MIR MEDICAL EXAMINATION<|>GPT-4 was evaluated on its performance in the MIR medical examination, including image analysis<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-4<|>GPT-3.5<|>GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 in the MIR medical examination<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIR MEDICAL EXAMINATION<|>SPAIN<|>The MIR medical examination is conducted in Spain and is specific to medical specialist training in the country<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-4<|>PHARMACOLOGY<|>GPT-4's performance was analyzed in the Pharmacology specialty during the MIR examination<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-4<|>CRITICAL CARE<|>GPT-4's performance was analyzed in the Critical Care specialty during the MIR examination<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPT-4<|>INFECTIOUS DISEASES<|>GPT-4's performance was analyzed in the Infectious Diseases specialty during the MIR examination<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
