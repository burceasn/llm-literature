AI technologies such as machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and computer vision enable AI systems to perform intelligent functions like knowledge acquisition, problem-solving, and decision-making. These technologies are most useful in healthcare as they organize and provide insights from large clinical and patient records in decision making processes in order to improve health care. Nevertheless, the following issues are some of the challenges that need to be considered for proper implementation of AI in the Nursing Education especially in China. These are issues such as technological requirements, information security, and other petty issues including the issue of ethics as well as issues of the resistance that is likely to be encountered from the practitioners in the field, students included. However, the prospects of AI, XR, and VR technologies in improving the delivery of nursing education and equipping students with adequate preparation to work in today’s advanced health systems cannot be underestimated. © 2024, Malque Publishing.
