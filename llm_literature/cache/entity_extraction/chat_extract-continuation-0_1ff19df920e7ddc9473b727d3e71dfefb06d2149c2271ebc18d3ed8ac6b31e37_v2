ChatGPT's use of natural language processing enables it to analyze complex medical data, aiding in early cancer detection and personalized treatment planning based on evidence-based guidelines. Furthermore, as an educational tool, ChatGPT promotes better understanding of medical concepts among healthcare professionals and patients alike, fostering informed decision-making and active participation in healthcare. However, challenges such as ethical considerations regarding patient privacy, data security, and biases in AI algorithms require careful attention. Adequate support in terms of infrastructure and training is crucial for the successful integration of ChatGPT into clinical practice. Collaboration among stakeholders is essential to overcome these challenges and fully harness the benefits of AI in improving outcomes for oral oncology patients.
