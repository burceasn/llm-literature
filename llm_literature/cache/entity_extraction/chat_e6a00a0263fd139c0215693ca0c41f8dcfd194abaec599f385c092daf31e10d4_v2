This paper proposes an innovative cloud-based solution that automates medical report analysis and leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver relevant insights, revolutionizing patient care. The system integrates a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine within an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline. This pipeline seamlessly extracts vital information from unstructured patient reports and test results, meticulously standardizing it for streamlined interoperability. This rich, structured data then fuels Large Language Models (LLM). Using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) we can generate accurate insights into patient reports. These models generate concise summaries, highlighting key clinical findings, and confidently suggest potential diagnoses, aiding physiciansin rapid decision-making. The system incorporates interactive data visualizations powered by advanced tools like Quicksightto facilitate deeper exploration and knowledge discovery. Initial testing validates the system's efficacy, demonstrating its ability to accurately summarize critical findings and propose diagnoses with relatively high confidence. This solution holds immense potential to revolutionize healthcare efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately deliver superior patient outcomes by alleviating the burden of data analysis and providing intelligent medical AI support. © 2024 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
