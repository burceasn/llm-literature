Materials and Methods: We extended the easy data augmentation (EDA) method for biomedical named entity recognition (NER) by incorporating the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge and called this method UMLS-EDA. We designed experiments to systematically evaluate the effect of UMLS-EDA on popular deep learning architectures for both NER and classification. We also compared UMLS-EDA to BERT. Results: UMLS-EDA enables substantial improvement for NER tasks from the original long short-term memory conditional random fields (LSTM-CRF) model (micro-F1 score: +5%, + 17%, and +15%), helps the LSTM-CRF model (micro-F1 score: 0.66) outperform LSTM-CRF with transfer learning by BERT (0.63), and improves the performance of the state-of-the-art sentence classification model. The largest gain on micro-F1 score is 9%, from 0.75 to 0.84, better than classifiers with BERT pretraining (0.82). Conclusions: This study presents a UMLS-based data augmentation method, UMLS-EDA. It is effective at improving deep learning models for both NER and sentence classification, and contributes original insights for designing new, superior deep learning approaches for low-resource biomedical domains. © 2020 The Author(s).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UMLS-EDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UMLS-EDA is a knowledge-based data augmentation method developed to improve the performance of deep learning models for biomedical natural language processing by incorporating the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM (UMLS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a knowledge source used to enhance the UMLS-EDA method for biomedical named entity recognition (NER) and classification tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LSTM-CRF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LSTM-CRF is a deep learning model used for named entity recognition (NER) tasks, which was improved by the UMLS-EDA method)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a state-of-the-art deep learning model used for comparison with the UMLS-EDA method in NER and classification tasks)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UMLS-EDA<|>UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM (UMLS)<|>UMLS-EDA incorporates the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge to improve deep learning models<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UMLS-EDA<|>LSTM-CRF<|>UMLS-EDA significantly improves the performance of the LSTM-CRF model for NER tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UMLS-EDA<|>BERT<|>UMLS-EDA outperforms BERT in improving the performance of deep learning models for NER and classification tasks<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
