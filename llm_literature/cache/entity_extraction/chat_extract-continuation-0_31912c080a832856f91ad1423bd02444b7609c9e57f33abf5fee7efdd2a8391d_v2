These techniques are especially vulnerable to domain-related difficulties, especially when dealing in Big data. In addition, labeling is time-consuming and supervised machine learning algorithms often lack labeled data. Transfer learning can help save time and obtain high performance with fewer datasets in this field. To cope this, we used a transfer learning-based Multi-Domain Sentiment Classification (MDSC) technique. We are able to identify the sentiment polarity of text in a target domain that is unlabeled by looking at reviews in a labelled source domain. This research aims to evaluate the impact of domain adaptation and measure the extent to which transfer learning enhances sentiment analysis outcomes. We employed transfer learning models BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and ULMFiT to improve the performance in sentiment analysis. We analyzed sentiment through various transformer models and compared the performance of LSTM and CNN. The experiments are carried on five publicly available sentiment analysis datasets, namely Hotel Reviews (HR), Movie Reviews (MR), Sentiment140 Tweets (ST), Citation Sentiment Corpus (CSC), and Bioinformatics Citation Corpus (BCC), to adapt multi-target domains. The performance of numerous models employing transfer learning from diverse datasets demonstrating how various factors influence the outputs. Copyright: © 2024 Ijaz et al.
