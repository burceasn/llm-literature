However, as techniques continue to advance and become more complex, it is increasingly challenging for clinicians to stay abreast of the latest research. This overview aims to translate research concepts and potential concerns to healthcare professionals interested in applying AI and ML to resuscitation research but who are not experts in the field. Main text: We present various research including prediction models using structured and unstructured data, exploring treatment heterogeneity, reinforcement learning, language processing, and large-scale language models. These studies potentially offer valuable insights for optimizing treatment strategies and clinical workflows. However, implementing AI and ML in clinical settings presents its own set of challenges. The availability of high-quality and reliable data is crucial for developing accurate ML models. A rigorous validation process and the integration of ML into clinical practice is essential for practical implementation. We furthermore highlight the potential risks associated with self-fulfilling prophecies and feedback loops, emphasizing the importance of transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness in AI and ML models. These issues need to be addressed in order to establish reliable and trustworthy AI and ML models. Conclusion: In this article, we overview concepts and examples of AI and ML research in the resuscitation field. Moving forward, appropriate understanding of ML and collaboration with relevant experts will be essential for researchers and clinicians to overcome the challenges and harness the full potential of AI and ML in resuscitation. © 2023 The Author(s)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
