Materials and methods: Retrospective data on 2.1 million adult and pediatric ED visits was obtained from a large healthcare system covering the period of March 2013 to July 2019. A total of 355 497 (16.4%) visits from 65 737 (8.9%) patients were removed for absence of either a structured or unstructured chief complaint. To ensure adequate training set size, chief complaint labels that comprised less than 0.01%, or 1 in 10 000, of all visits were excluded. The cutoff threshold was incremented on a log scale to create seven datasets of decreasing sparsity. The classification task was to predict the provider-assigned label from the free-text chief complaint using BERT, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) as baselines. Performance was measured as the Top-k accuracy from k ¼ 1:5 on a hold-out test set comprising 5% of the samples. The embedding for each free-text chief complaint was extracted as the final 768-dimensional layer of the BERT model and visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Results: The models achieved increasing performance with datasets of decreasing sparsity, with BERT outperforming both LSTM and ELMo. The BERT model yielded Top-1 accuracies of 0.65 and 0.69, Top-3 accuracies of 0.87 and 0.90, and Top-5 accuracies of 0.92 and 0.94 on datasets comprised of 434 and 188 labels, respectively. Visualization using t-SNE mapped the learned embeddings in a clinically meaningful way, with related concepts embedded close to each other and broader types of chief complaints clustered together. Discussion: Despite the inherent noise in the chief complaint label space, the model was able to learn a rich representation of chief complaints and generate reasonable predictions of their labels. The learned embeddings accurately predict provider-assigned chief complaint labels and map semantically similar chief complaints to nearby points in vector space. Conclusion: Such a model may be used to automatically map free-text chief complaints to structured fields and to assist the development of a standardized, data-driven ontology of chief complaints for healthcare institutions. © The Author(s) 2020.
