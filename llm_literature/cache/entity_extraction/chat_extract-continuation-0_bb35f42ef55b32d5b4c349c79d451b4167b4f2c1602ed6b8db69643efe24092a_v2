Despite this interest there is sparse analysis of their use in qualitative thematic analysis comparing their current ability to that of human coding and analysis. In addition, there has been no published analysis of their use in real-world, protected health information. Objective: Here we fill that gap in the literature by comparing an LLM to standard human thematic analysis in real-world, semi-structured interviews of both patients and clinicians within a psychiatric setting. Methods: Using a 70 billion parameter open-source LLM running on local hardware and advanced prompt engineering techniques, we produced themes that summarized a full corpus of interviews in minutes. Subsequently we used three different evaluation methods for quantifying similarity between themes produced by the LLM and those produced by humans. Results: These revealed similarities ranging from moderate to substantial (Jaccard similarity coefficients 0.44–0.69), which are promising preliminary results. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that open-source LLMs can effectively generate robust themes from qualitative data, achieving substantial similarity to human-generated themes. The validation of LLMs in thematic analysis, coupled with evaluation methodologies, highlights their potential to enhance and democratize qualitative research across diverse fields. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large language models are generative artificial intelligence systems that have sparked interest in clinical and research settings for their utility in qualitative thematic analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELSEVIER B.V.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Elsevier B.V. is the publisher of the study on the use of LLMs in qualitative thematic analysis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSYCHIATRIC SETTING<|>GEO<|>The psychiatric setting is the environment where the semi-structured interviews of patients and clinicians were conducted)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUALITATIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Qualitative thematic analysis is the process of identifying themes in qualitative data, which was performed by both humans and LLMs in this study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACCARD SIMILARITY COEFFICIENTS<|>EVENT<|>Jaccard similarity coefficients are a method used to quantify the similarity between themes produced by LLMs and humans, ranging from 0.44 to 0.69 in this study)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>QUALITATIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS<|>LLMs were used to perform qualitative thematic analysis on semi-structured interviews<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>PSYCHIATRIC SETTING<|>LLMs were applied to analyze data from a psychiatric setting<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>JACCARD SIMILARITY COEFFICIENTS<|>Jaccard similarity coefficients were used to evaluate the similarity between LLM-generated and human-generated themes<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELSEVIER B.V.<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>Elsevier B.V. published the study on the use of LLMs in qualitative thematic analysis<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
