These models, which are based on deep learning techniques like transformer architectures, have been painstakingly trained on massive text datasets. This study paper takes an in-depth look into LLMs, including their architecture, historical evolution, and applications in education, healthcare, and finance sector. LLMs provide logical replies by interpreting complicated verbal patterns, making them beneficial in a variety of real-world scenarios. Their development and implementation, however, raise ethical concerns and have societal ramifications. Understanding the importance and limitations of LLMs is critical for guiding future research and ensuring the ethical use of their enormous potential. This survey exposes the influence of these models as they change, providing a roadmap for researchers, developers, and policymakers navigating the world of artificial intelligence and language processing. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024. corrected publication 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large language models are advanced AI systems based on deep learning techniques, used for interpreting and creating human language in various sectors like education, healthcare, and finance)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER-VERLAG LONDON LTD.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer-Verlag London Ltd. is a publishing organization that holds exclusive rights to the publication of the study paper on LLMs)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature is the parent organization of Springer-Verlag London Ltd., which published the study paper on LLMs)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>SPRINGER-VERLAG LONDON LTD.<|>Springer-Verlag London Ltd. published the study paper on large language models<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINGER-VERLAG LONDON LTD.<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>Springer-Verlag London Ltd. is part of Springer Nature<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
