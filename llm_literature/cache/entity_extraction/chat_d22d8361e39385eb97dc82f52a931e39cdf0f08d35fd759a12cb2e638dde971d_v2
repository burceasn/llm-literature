The proposed recognition method is intended to serve in a therapeutic dialogue system to analyze sentiment and emotion in human utterances. First, the language model is enhanced, by replacing the BERT neural language model with RoBERTa. Next, the emotion-based text corpus is enlarged. A novel process of augmenting an emotion-labeled text corpus using semantically similar data from an unlabeled corpus, inspired by semi-supervised learning methods, is proposed. The process of using the Common Crawl web archive to create an enlarged corpus, named CORTEX+pCC, is presented. An empathetic dialogue system named Terabot, incorporating the elaborated method, is also described. The system is designed to employ elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychiatric patients. The improved language model trained on the enlarged CORTEX+pCC corpus resulted in remarkably improved sentiment and emotion recognition. The average accuracy and F1 scores increased by around 3% and 8% relative, which will allow the dialogue system to operate more appropriately for the emotional state of the patient. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
