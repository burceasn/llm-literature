Assertion detection in clinical NLP usually involves identifying assertion types for medical concepts in the clinical text, namely certainty (whether the medical concept is positive, negated, possible, or hypothetical), temporality (whether the medical concept is for present or the past history), and experiencer (whether the medical concept is described for the patient or a family member). These assertion types are essential for healthcare professionals to quickly and clearly understand the context of medical conditions from unstructured clinical texts, directly influencing the quality and outcomes of patient care. Although widely used, traditional methods, particularly rule-based NLP systems and machine learning or deep learning models, demand intensive manual efforts to create patterns and tend to overlook less common assertion types, leading to an incomplete understanding of the context. To address this challenge, our research introduces a novel methodology that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on a vast array of medical data for assertion detection. We enhanced the current method with advanced reasoning techniques, including Tree of Thought (ToT), Chain of Thought (CoT), and Self-Consistency (SC), and refine it further with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. We first evaluated the model on the i2b2 2010 assertion dataset. Our method achieved a micro-averaged F-1 of 0.89, with 0.11 improvements over the previous works. To further assess the generalizability of our approach, we extended our evaluation to a local dataset that focused on sleep concept extraction. Our approach achieved an F-1 of 0.74, which is 0.31 higher than the previous method. The results show that using LLMs is a viable option for assertion detection in clinical NLP and can potentially integrate with other LLM-based concept extraction models for clinical NLP tasks. © 2024 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IEEE is the organization that published the research study on assertion detection in clinical NLP)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>I2B2 2010 ASSERTION DATASET<|>EVENT<|>The i2b2 2010 assertion dataset is a benchmark dataset used to evaluate the performance of assertion detection models in clinical NLP)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large Language Models are advanced AI models pre-trained on vast amounts of data, used in this study for assertion detection in clinical NLP)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TREE OF THOUGHT (TOT)<|>EVENT<|>Tree of Thought is an advanced reasoning technique used to enhance the performance of assertion detection models)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHAIN OF THOUGHT (COT)<|>EVENT<|>Chain of Thought is an advanced reasoning technique used to improve the reasoning capabilities of assertion detection models)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SELF-CONSISTENCY (SC)<|>EVENT<|>Self-Consistency is a reasoning technique used to refine the outputs of assertion detection models)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LOW-RANK ADAPTATION (LORA)<|>EVENT<|>Low-Rank Adaptation is a fine-tuning technique used to optimize the performance of assertion detection models)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>I2B2 2010 ASSERTION DATASET<|>Large Language Models were evaluated on the i2b2 2010 assertion dataset for assertion detection<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TREE OF THOUGHT (TOT)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>Tree of Thought was used to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CHAIN OF THOUGHT (COT)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>Chain of Thought was used to improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SELF-CONSISTENCY (SC)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>Self-Consistency was used to refine the outputs of Large Language Models<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LOW-RANK ADAPTATION (LORA)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>Low-Rank Adaptation was used to fine-tune Large Language Models for assertion detection<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IEEE<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>IEEE published the research study that utilized Large Language Models for assertion detection<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
