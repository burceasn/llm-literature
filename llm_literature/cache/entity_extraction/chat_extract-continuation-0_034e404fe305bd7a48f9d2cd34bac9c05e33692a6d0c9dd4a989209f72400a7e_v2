Our proposed methodology involves the development of a BERT-based medical chatbot, leveraging cutting-edge deep learning technology to significantly enhance healthcare communication and accessibility. The traditional challenges faced by medical chatbots, such as imprecise understanding of medical conversations, inaccurate responses to jargon, and the inability to offer personalized feedback, are addressed through the utilization of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The performance metrics of our chatbot underscore its effectiveness. With an accuracy of 98%, the chatbot ensures a high level of precision in handling medical queries. The precision score of 97% attests to the accuracy and reliability of its responses. The AUC-ROC score of 97% indicates the chatbot's exceptional ability to predict specific diseases based on user queries and symptoms, showcasing its robust predictive power. Furthermore, a recall of 96% demonstrates the chatbot's capability to avoid missing cases in medical diagnoses, ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential conditions. The F1 score of 98% showcases the chatbot's proficiency in delivering accurate and personalized healthcare information, striking a harmonious balance between precision and recall. Our BERT-based medical chatbot not only addresses the limitations of traditional approaches but also achieves a remarkable performance with high accuracy, precision, predictive power, and comprehensive coverage, making it a valuable tool for advancing the quality of healthcare services. © 2024\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a modern technology that has transformed healthcare by offering innovative solutions for personalized healthcare and enhancing medical services)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNET OF THINGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Internet of Things (IoT) is a modern technology that has contributed to the transformation of healthcare by enabling innovative solutions for personalized healthcare)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deep Learning (DL) is a modern technology that has revolutionized healthcare by enabling the development of advanced tools like the BERT-based medical chatbot)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT-BASED MEDICAL CHATBOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A BERT-based medical chatbot is a tool developed using deep learning technology to enhance healthcare communication and accessibility, addressing traditional challenges like imprecise understanding of medical conversations and inaccurate responses)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a deep learning technology used to develop the medical chatbot, enabling it to handle medical queries with high accuracy and precision)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>BERT-BASED MEDICAL CHATBOT<|>Artificial Intelligence is a foundational technology used in the development of the BERT-based medical chatbot<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>BERT-BASED MEDICAL CHATBOT<|>Deep Learning is the core technology used to develop the BERT-based medical chatbot<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS<|>BERT-BASED MEDICAL CHATBOT<|>BERT is the specific deep learning model used to create the medical chatbot<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNET OF THINGS<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>Both IoT and AI are modern technologies contributing to the transformation of healthcare<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
