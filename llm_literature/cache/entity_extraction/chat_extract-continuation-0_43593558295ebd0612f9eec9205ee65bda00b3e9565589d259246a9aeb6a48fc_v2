These applications utilize a variety of medical data, including laboratory results, clinical findings, MRI scans, tomographic images, and radiological images. In addition, free-text healthcare documentation, such as well-structured discharge summaries, contains valuable information. Natural Language Processing encompasses the development of automated systems for generating health reports. This process involves using domain-specific knowledge and prior knowledge to extract relevant information from medical records. This article investigates the use of natural language processing techniques for chest X-ray classification. A total of 14 distinct impressions derived from chest radiography findings from the MIMIC-CXR dataset were used in a multi-label classification procedure. Six distinct language models derived from the BERT language model, along with three distinct classification algorithms, were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the models and the dataset for multi-label categorization. The experimental results showed a successful prediction rate of 80.47% for 14 distinct impressions within the dataset.  © 2024 The Authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The healthcare industry is undergoing digitization, leading to the development of applications using machine learning and image processing techniques to improve diagnostics.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIMIC-CXR DATASET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A dataset containing chest radiography findings used in a multi-label classification procedure for chest X-ray classification.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT LANGUAGE MODEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A language model used to derive six distinct language models for evaluating the effectiveness of multi-label categorization in chest X-ray classification.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>EVENT<|>A process involving the development of automated systems for generating health reports by extracting relevant information from medical records.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEST X-RAY CLASSIFICATION<|>EVENT<|>An experimental procedure using natural language processing techniques to classify 14 distinct impressions derived from chest radiography findings.)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>The healthcare industry utilizes natural language processing to improve diagnostic processes and generate health reports.<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIMIC-CXR DATASET<|>CHEST X-RAY CLASSIFICATION<|>The MIMIC-CXR dataset was used in the chest X-ray classification procedure to evaluate 14 distinct impressions.<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT LANGUAGE MODEL<|>CHEST X-RAY CLASSIFICATION<|>Six distinct language models derived from BERT were employed in the chest X-ray classification procedure.<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>CHEST X-RAY CLASSIFICATION<|>Natural language processing techniques were used to classify chest X-ray findings.<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
