Medical applications of ChatGPT, a powerful language model based on the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) architecture, encompass the creation of conversational agents capable of accessing and generating medical information from multiple sources and formats. This study investigates the research trends of large language models such as ChatGPT, GPT 4, and Google Bard, comparing their publication trends with early COVID-19 research. The findings underscore the current prominence of AI research and its potential implications in biomedical engineering. A search of the Scopus database on July 23, 2023, yielded 1,096 articles related to ChatGPT, with approximately 26% being medical science-related. Keywords related to artificial intelligence, natural language processing (NLP), LLM, and generative AI dominate ChatGPT research, while a focused representation of medical science research emerges, with emphasis on biomedical research and engineering. This analysis serves as a call to action for researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers to recognize and harness AI's potential in healthcare, particularly in the realm of biomedical research. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Biomedical Engineering Society 2023.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
