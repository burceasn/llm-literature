More specifically, we will discuss the opportunities for AI in lowering healthcare costs and supporting transformational shifts in our care model in the following domains: predictive analytics for optimising throughput and appropriate referrals, computer vision for image enhancement (to increase scanner efficiency and decrease radiation exposure) and pattern recognition (to aid human interpretation and worklist prioritisation), natural language processing and large language models for optimising reports and text data-mining. In the context of preventive health, we will discuss how AI can support population level screening for major disease burdens through opportunistic screening and democratise expertise to increase access to radiological services in primary and community care. 2023 Sim, Bhanu Prakash, Huang and Tan.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SINGAPORE HEALTHCARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Singapore healthcare is referenced as an example of a healthcare sector that could benefit from incorporating AI into radiology workflows to improve productivity and cost savings)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIM<|>PERSON<|>Sim is one of the authors of the review article discussing AI in radiology and healthcare cost optimization)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHANU PRAKASH<|>PERSON<|>Bhanu Prakash is one of the authors of the review article discussing AI in radiology and healthcare cost optimization)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUANG<|>PERSON<|>Huang is one of the authors of the review article discussing AI in radiology and healthcare cost optimization)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAN<|>PERSON<|>Tan is one of the authors of the review article discussing AI in radiology and healthcare cost optimization)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN RADIOLOGY<|>EVENT<|>The incorporation of AI into radiology workflows to improve productivity, reduce costs, and support transformational shifts in healthcare models)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIM<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN RADIOLOGY<|>Sim co-authored a review article discussing the potential of AI in radiology<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BHANU PRAKASH<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN RADIOLOGY<|>Bhanu Prakash co-authored a review article discussing the potential of AI in radiology<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUANG<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN RADIOLOGY<|>Huang co-authored a review article discussing the potential of AI in radiology<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAN<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN RADIOLOGY<|>Tan co-authored a review article discussing the potential of AI in radiology<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SINGAPORE HEALTHCARE<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN RADIOLOGY<|>Singapore healthcare is used as an example of a sector that could benefit from AI in radiology<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
