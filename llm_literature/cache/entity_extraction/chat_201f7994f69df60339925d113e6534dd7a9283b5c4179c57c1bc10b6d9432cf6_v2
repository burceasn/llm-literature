The tool utilizes natural language processing algorithms based on Large Language Models (LLM) to extract chemical entities from biomedical text documents. The tool provides students with a starting point for their research in a case-based learning exercise, and by using Large Language Models and Linked Open Data, it shows them a path to follow. The system shows a description of the molecules, a 3D view, a 2D structure information, and a panel with scientific articles about the selected chemical compound obtained from the Scielo portal, a repository of scientific publications. The application has a modular architecture that allows for easy addition of new functionalities in the future. The web interface let users to input the text of the clinical case for processing and studying. The functionality of querying scientific articles can be expanded with new modules to obtain information from other repositories. Overall, this software tool provides a comprehensive and innovative approach to learning chemical molecules for healthcare students, which can help them develop the necessary skills to tackle real-life problems as healthcare professionals.  © 2023 ACM.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
