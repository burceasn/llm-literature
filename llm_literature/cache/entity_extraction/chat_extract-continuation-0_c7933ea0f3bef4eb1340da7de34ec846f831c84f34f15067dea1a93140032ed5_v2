This study focuses on total hip, knee, and shoulder arthroplasty procedures as they account for most joint replacement surgeries. Apart from being a burden to healthcare systems, readmissions are also troublesome for patients. There are several studies which only utilized structured data from Electronic Health Records (EHR) without considering any gender and payor bias adjustments. Methods: For this study, dataset of 38,581 total knee, hip, and shoulder replacement surgeries performed from 2015 to 2021 at Novant Health was gathered. This data was used to train a random forest machine learning model to predict the combined endpoint of emergency department (ED) visit or unplanned readmissions within 30 days of discharge or discharge to Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) following the surgery. 98 features of laboratory results, diagnoses, vitals, medications, and utilization history were extracted. A natural language processing (NLP) model finetuned from Clinical BERT was used to generate an NLP risk score feature for each patient based on their clinical notes. To address societal biases, a feature bias analysis was performed in conjunction with propensity score matching. A threshold optimization algorithm from the Fairlearn toolkit was used to mitigate gender and payor biases to promote fairness in predictions. Results: The model achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.738 (95% confidence interval, 0.724 to 0.754) and an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.406 (95% confidence interval, 0.384 to 0.433). Considering an outcome prevalence of 16%, these metrics indicate the model’s ability to accurately discriminate between readmission and non-readmission cases within the context of total arthroplasty surgeries while adjusting patient scores in the model to mitigate bias based on patient gender and payor. Conclusion: This work culminated in a model that identifies the most predictive and protective features associated with the combined endpoint. This model serves as a tool to empower healthcare providers to proactively intervene based on these influential factors without introducing bias towards protected patient classes, effectively mitigating the risk of negative outcomes and ultimately improving quality of care regardless of socioeconomic factors. © The Author(s) 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) imposes payment penalties for readmissions following total joint replacement surgeries, focusing on healthcare regulations and policies.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOVANT HEALTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Novant Health is a healthcare organization where 38,581 total knee, hip, and shoulder replacement surgeries were performed from 2015 to 2021, providing the dataset for this study.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIRLEARN TOOLKIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fairlearn toolkit is a tool used to mitigate gender and payor biases in machine learning models, promoting fairness in predictions.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLINICAL BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Clinical BERT is a natural language processing (NLP) model finetuned to generate NLP risk score features for patients based on their clinical notes.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOTAL JOINT REPLACEMENT SURGERIES<|>EVENT<|>Total joint replacement surgeries, including hip, knee, and shoulder arthroplasty, are the focus of this study, as they account for most joint replacement surgeries and are associated with readmission penalties.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISIT<|>EVENT<|>An emergency department (ED) visit is one of the combined endpoints studied, along with unplanned readmissions, within 30 days of discharge following surgery.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNPLANNED READMISSIONS<|>EVENT<|>Unplanned readmissions are a key endpoint studied in this research, occurring within 30 days of discharge following total joint replacement surgeries.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKILLED NURSING FACILITY (SNF)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) is a type of healthcare facility where patients may be discharged following surgery, and its use is studied as part of the combined endpoint.)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTER FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS)<|>TOTAL JOINT REPLACEMENT SURGERIES<|>CMS imposes payment penalties for readmissions following total joint replacement surgeries, influencing healthcare policies and practices.<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOVANT HEALTH<|>TOTAL JOINT REPLACEMENT SURGERIES<|>Novant Health provided the dataset of 38,581 total joint replacement surgeries performed from 2015 to 2021, which was used in this study.<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAIRLEARN TOOLKIT<|>NOVANT HEALTH<|>The Fairlearn toolkit was used in conjunction with Novant Health's dataset to mitigate gender and payor biases in the machine learning model.<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINICAL BERT<|>NOVANT HEALTH<|>Clinical BERT was used to generate NLP risk score features for patients in Novant Health's dataset based on their clinical notes.<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISIT<|>UNPLANNED READMISSIONS<|>Both ED visits and unplanned readmissions are combined endpoints studied within 30 days of discharge following surgery.<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SKILLED NURSING FACILITY (SNF)<|>TOTAL JOINT REPLACEMENT SURGERIES<|>Discharge to a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) is a potential outcome studied in the context of total joint replacement surgeries.<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
