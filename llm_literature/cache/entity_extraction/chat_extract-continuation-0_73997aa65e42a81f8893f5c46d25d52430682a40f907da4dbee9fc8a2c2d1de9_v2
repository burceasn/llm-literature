Objectives: This study assessed the effectiveness of a popular large language model, ChatGPT-4, in predicting Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes from surgical operative notes. By employing a combination of prompt engineering, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning techniques on standard operative notes, the study sought to enhance billing efficiency, optimize revenue collection, and reduce coding errors. Methods: The model was given 3 different types of prompts for 50 surgical operative notes from 2 spine surgeons. The first trial was simply asking the model to generate CPT codes for a given OP note. The second trial included 3 OP notes and associated CPT codes to, and the third trial included a list of every possible CPT code in the dataset to prime the model. CPT codes generated by the model were compared to those generated by the billing department. Model evaluation was performed in the form of calculating the area under the ROC (AUROC), and area under precision-recall curves (AUPRC). Results: The trial that involved priming ChatGPT with a list of every possible CPT code performed the best, with an AUROC of.87 and an AUPRC of.67, and an AUROC of.81 and AUPRC of.76 when examining only the most common CPT codes. Conclusions: ChatGPT-4 can aid in automating CPT billing from orthopedic surgery operative notes, driving down healthcare expenditures and enhancing billing code precision as the model evolves and fine-tuning becomes available. © The Author(s) 2023.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT-4<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT-4 is a large language model used in the study to predict Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes from surgical operative notes, employing prompt engineering, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning techniques)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURRENT PROCEDURAL TERMINOLOGY (CPT)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CPT is a coding system used in the study to classify medical procedures and services for billing purposes)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPINE SURGEONS<|>PERSON<|>Two spine surgeons provided 50 surgical operative notes used in the study to evaluate ChatGPT-4's performance in predicting CPT codes)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILLING DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The billing department generated CPT codes for comparison with those predicted by ChatGPT-4 in the study)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STUDY<|>EVENT<|>The study assessed the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4 in predicting CPT codes from surgical operative notes, aiming to enhance billing efficiency and reduce coding errors)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT-4<|>STUDY<|>ChatGPT-4 was evaluated in the study to predict CPT codes from surgical operative notes<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPINE SURGEONS<|>STUDY<|>Two spine surgeons provided surgical operative notes used in the study<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILLING DEPARTMENT<|>STUDY<|>The billing department's CPT codes were used as a benchmark for comparison in the study<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CURRENT PROCEDURAL TERMINOLOGY (CPT)<|>STUDY<|>CPT codes were the focus of the study, with ChatGPT-4 predicting them from surgical operative notes<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
