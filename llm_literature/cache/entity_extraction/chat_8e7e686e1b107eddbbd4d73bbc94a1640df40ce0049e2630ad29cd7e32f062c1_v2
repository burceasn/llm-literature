However, text data processing requires a lot of time and effort, which limits the utilization of these data. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) technology, including large language models, can be applied to cancer research. Particularly, extracting the information required for the pathological stage from surgical pathology reports can be utilized to update cancer staging according to the latest cancer staging guidelines. Objectives: This study has two main objectives. The first objective is to evaluate the performance of extracting information from text-based surgical pathology reports and determining pathological stages based on the extracted information using fine-tuned generative language models (GLMs) for patients with lung cancer. The second objective is to determine the feasibility of utilizing relatively small GLMs for information extraction in a resource-constrained computing environment. Methods: Lung cancer surgical pathology reports were collected from the Common Data Model database of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH), a tertiary hospital in Korea. We selected 42 descriptors necessary for tumor-node (TN) classification based on these reports and created a gold standard with validation by two clinical experts. The pathology reports and gold standard were used to generate prompt-response pairs for training and evaluating GLMs which then were used to extract information required for staging from pathology reports. Results: We evaluated the information extraction performance of six trained models as well as their performance in TN classification using the extracted information. The Deductive Mistral-7B model, which was pre-trained with the deductive dataset, showed the best performance overall, with an exact match ratio of 92.24% in the information extraction problem and an accuracy of 0.9876 (predicting T and N classification concurrently) in classification. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that training GLMs with deductive datasets can improve information extraction performance, and GLMs with a relatively small number of parameters at approximately seven billion can achieve high performance in this problem. The proposed GLM-based information extraction method is expected to be useful in clinical decision-making support, lung cancer staging and research. © 2024 The Authors\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
