Researchers and doctors have started thinking about the promise and application of AI-related large language models in medicine during the past few months. Here, the comprehensive review highlighted the overview of Chatbot and ChatGPT and their current role in medicine. Firstly, the general idea of Chatbots, their evolution, architecture, and medical use are discussed. Secondly, ChatGPT is discussed with special emphasis of its application in medicine, architecture and training methods, medical diagnosis and treatment, research ethical issues, and a comparison of ChatGPT with other NLP models are illustrated. The article also discussed the limitations and prospects of ChatGPT. In the future, these large language models and ChatGPT will have immense promise in healthcare. However, more research is needed in this direction.
