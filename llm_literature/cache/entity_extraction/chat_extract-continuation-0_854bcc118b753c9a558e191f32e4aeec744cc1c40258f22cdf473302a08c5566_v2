Despite its lack of domain-specific training, ChatGPT has developed remarkable accuracy in interpreting clinical information. In this article, we aim to assess what role ChatGPT can serve in medical writing. We recruited a first-year medical student with no prior experience in writing case reports to write a case report on a complex surgery with the assistance of ChatGPT. After a thorough evaluation of its responses, we believe that ChatGPT is a powerful medical writing tool that can be used to generate summaries, proofread, and provide valuable medical insight. However, ChatGPT is not a substitute for a study author due to several significant limitations, and should instead be used in conjunction with the author during the writing process. As the impact of natural language processing models such as ChatGPT grows, we suggest that guidelines be established on how to better utilize this technology to improve clinical research rather than outright prohibiting its usage. © 2023 The Authors\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a chatbot built on a natural language processing model that generates human-like responses and has shown accuracy in interpreting clinical information.
