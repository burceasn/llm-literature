Here, a narrative review has been proposed utilizing a standardized checklist and quality control procedure for including scientific papers. This narrative review explores the early developments and potential future impact of these technologies in medical diagnostics. The current literature, comprising 11 studies (after excluding comments, letters, and editorials) suggests that chatbots and NLP offer significant opportunities to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline clinical workflows, and improve patient engagement. By automating the extraction and classification of medical information, these technologies can reduce human error and increase precision. They also promise to make patient information more accessible and facilitate complex decision-making processes, thereby fostering greater patient involvement in healthcare. Despite these promising prospects, several challenges need to be addressed for the full potential of these technologies to be realized. These include the need for data standardization, mitigation of biases in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, and comprehensive clinical validation. Furthermore, ethical, privacy, and legal considerations must be navigated carefully to ensure responsible AI deployment. Compared to the more established fields of histology, histopathology, and especially radiology, the integration of digital tools in cytology and cytopathology is still in its infancy. Building on the advancements in related fields, especially radiology’s experience with digital integration, where these technologies already offer promising solutions in mentoring, second opinions, and education, we can leverage this knowledge to further develop chatbots and natural language processing in cytology and cytopathology. Overall, this review underscores the transformative potential of these technologies while outlining the critical areas for future research and development. © 2024 by the authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
