Thematic analysis, a qualitative research method to identify and interpret patterns in data, is one application that stands to benefit from this technology. This viewpoint explores the use of ChatGPT in three core phases of thematic analysis within a medical context: (1) direct coding of transcripts, (2) generating themes from a predefined list of codes, and (3) preprocessing quotes for manuscript inclusion. Additionally, we explore the potential of ChatGPT to generate interview transcripts, which may be used for training purposes. We assess the strengths and limitations of using ChatGPT in these roles, highlighting areas where human intervention remains necessary. Overall, we argue that ChatGPT can function as a valuable tool during analysis, enhancing the efficiency of the thematic analysis and offering additional insights into the qualitative data. While ChatGPT may not adequately capture the full context of each participant, it can serve as an additional member of the analysis team, contributing to researcher triangulation through knowledge building and sensemaking.
