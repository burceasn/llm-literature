These technologies have shown promising outcomes across various healthcare tasks, especially in widely studied languages like English and Chinese. While NLP methods have been extensively researched, LLM applications in healthcare represent a developing area with significant potential. However, the successful implementation of LLMs in healthcare requires careful review and guidance from human experts to ensure accuracy and reliability. Despite their emerging value, research on NLP and LLM applications for Arabic remains limited particularly when compared to other languages. This gap is largely due to challenges like the lack of suitable training datasets, the diversity of Arabic dialects, and the language’s structural complexity. In this study, a panel of medical experts evaluated responses generated by LLMs, including ChatGPT, for Arabic healthcare inquiries, rating their accuracy between 85% and 90%. After fine tuning ChatGPT with data from the Altibbi platform, accuracy improved to a range of 87% to 92%. This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs in addressing Arabic healthcare queries especially in interpreting questions across dialects. It highlights the value of LLMs in enhancing healthcare communication within the Arabic-speaking world and points to a promising area for further research. This work establishes a foundation for optimizing NLP and LLM technologies to achieve greater linguistic and cultural adaptability in global healthcare settings. © 2024 by the authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A field of study focused on the interaction between computers and human language, particularly in healthcare applications)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Advanced AI models used in healthcare to process and generate human language, with applications in various languages including English, Chinese, and Arabic)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A large language model developed by OpenAI, used in this study to evaluate Arabic healthcare inquiries)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALTIBBI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A platform providing healthcare data used to fine-tune ChatGPT for improved accuracy in Arabic healthcare queries)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARABIC-SPEAKING WORLD<|>GEO<|>A region where Arabic is the primary language, highlighted in this study for its potential to benefit from LLM applications in healthcare)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANEL OF MEDICAL EXPERTS<|>PERSON<|>A group of healthcare professionals who evaluated the accuracy of LLM-generated responses in Arabic healthcare inquiries)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STUDY ON NLP AND LLM APPLICATIONS<|>EVENT<|>A research effort evaluating the effectiveness of NLP and LLMs in addressing Arabic healthcare queries, demonstrating improved accuracy after fine-tuning)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>NLP techniques are foundational to the development and application of LLMs in healthcare<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ChatGPT is a specific example of a large language model used in this study<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ALTIBBI<|>ChatGPT was fine-tuned using data from the Altibbi platform to improve its accuracy in Arabic healthcare queries<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANEL OF MEDICAL EXPERTS<|>CHATGPT<|>The panel evaluated the accuracy of ChatGPT's responses to Arabic healthcare inquiries<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STUDY ON NLP AND LLM APPLICATIONS<|>ARABIC-SPEAKING WORLD<|>The study highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance healthcare communication in the Arabic-speaking world<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STUDY ON NLP AND LLM APPLICATIONS<|>CHATGPT<|>The study used ChatGPT to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in Arabic healthcare queries<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
