It aims to compare and analyse literature that applied AI algorithms for ENT disease prediction and detection based on their effectiveness, methods, dataset, and performance. We have also discussed ENT specialists’ challenges and AI’s role in solving them. This review also discusses the challenges faced by AI researchers. This systematic review was completed using PRISMA guidelines. Data was extracted from several reputable digital databases, including PubMed, Medline, SpringerLink, Elsevier, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and IEEExplore. The search criteria included studies recently published between 2018 and 2024 related to the application of AI for ENT healthcare. After removing duplicate studies and quality assessments, we reviewed eligible articles and responded to the research questions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of AI applications in ENT healthcare. Among the 3257 unique studies, 27 were selected as primary studies. About 62.5% of the included studies were effective in providing disease predictions. We found that Pretrained DL models are more in application than CNN algorithms when employed for ENT disease predictions. The accuracy of models ranged between 75 and 97%. We also observed the effectiveness of conversational AI models such as ChatGPT in the ENT discipline. The research in AI for ENT is advancing rapidly. Most of the models have achieved accuracy above 90%. However, the lack of good-quality data and data variability limits the overall ability of AI models to perform better for ENT disease prediction. Further research needs to be conducted while considering factors such as external validation and the issue of class imbalance. © Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS OF INDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Association of Otolaryngologists of India is the organization that published the systematic literature review on AI in ENT healthcare in 2024)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PRISMA GUIDELINES<|>EVENT<|>PRISMA guidelines were used to complete the systematic literature review on AI in ENT healthcare)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PUBMED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PubMed is a reputable digital database used to extract data for the systematic literature review)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MEDLINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Medline is a reputable digital database used to extract data for the systematic literature review)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGERLINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SpringerLink is a reputable digital database used to extract data for the systematic literature review)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ELSEVIER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Elsevier is a reputable digital database used to extract data for the systematic literature review)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE SCHOLAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Scholar is a reputable digital database used to extract data for the systematic literature review)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SCIENCEDIRECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ScienceDirect is a reputable digital database used to extract data for the systematic literature review)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IEEEXPLORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IEEExplore is a reputable digital database used to extract data for the systematic literature review)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a conversational AI model observed to be effective in the ENT discipline)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS OF INDIA<|>PRISMA GUIDELINES<|>The Association of Otolaryngologists of India used PRISMA guidelines to complete the systematic literature review<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS OF INDIA<|>PUBMED<|>The Association of Otolaryngologists of India extracted data from PubMed for the systematic literature review<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS OF INDIA<|>MEDLINE<|>The Association of Otolaryngologists of India extracted data from Medline for the systematic literature review<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS OF INDIA<|>SPRINGERLINK<|>The Association of Otolaryngologists of India extracted data from SpringerLink for the systematic literature review<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS OF INDIA<|>ELSEVIER<|>The Association of Otolaryngologists of India extracted data from Elsevier for the systematic literature review<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS OF INDIA<|>GOOGLE SCHOLAR<|>The Association of Otolaryngologists of India extracted data from Google Scholar for the systematic literature review<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS OF INDIA<|>SCIENCEDIRECT<|>The Association of Otolaryngologists of India extracted data from ScienceDirect for the systematic literature review<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS OF INDIA<|>IEEEXPLORE<|>The Association of Otolaryngologists of India extracted data from IEEExplore for the systematic literature review<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ASSOCIATION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS OF INDIA<|>ChatGPT was observed to be effective in the ENT discipline by the Association of Otolaryngologists of India<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
