We conduct an in-depth analysis, aiming to compare the merits and drawbacks of both machine learning and deep learning techniques, particularly within the framework of named-entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) tasks related to ADE extraction. Additionally, our focus extends to the examination of specific features and their impact on the overall performance of these methodologies. In a broader perspective, our research extends to ADE extraction from various sources, including biomedical literature, social media data, and drug labels, removing the limitation to exclusively machine learning or deep learning methods. Methods: We conducted an extensive literature review on PubMed using the query “(((machine learning [Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Terms]) OR (deep learning [MeSH Terms])) AND (adverse drug event [MeSH Terms])) AND (extraction)”, and supplemented this with a snowballing approach to review 275 references sourced from retrieved articles. Results: In our analysis, we included twelve articles for review. For the NER task, deep learning models outperformed machine learning models. In the RC task, gradient Boosting, multilayer perceptron and random forest models excelled. The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model consistently achieved the best performance in the end-to-end task. Future efforts in the end-to-end task should prioritize improving NER accuracy, especially for 'ADE' and 'Reason'. Conclusion: These findings hold significant implications for advancing the field of ADE extraction and pharmacovigilance, ultimately contributing to improved drug safety monitoring and healthcare outcomes. © 2024\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Machine learning is a methodology used in the context of extracting adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical benchmark datasets, particularly within the framework of named-entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deep learning is a methodology used in the context of extracting adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical benchmark datasets, particularly within the framework of named-entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBMED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PubMed is a database used for conducting an extensive literature review on machine learning and deep learning methodologies in the context of ADE extraction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a deep learning model that consistently achieved the best performance in the end-to-end task of ADE extraction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRADIENT BOOSTING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gradient Boosting is a machine learning model that excelled in the relation classification (RC) task of ADE extraction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Multilayer Perceptron is a machine learning model that excelled in the relation classification (RC) task of ADE extraction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANDOM FOREST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Random Forest is a machine learning model that excelled in the relation classification (RC) task of ADE extraction)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>Both machine learning and deep learning methodologies are used in the context of extracting adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical benchmark datasets<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>PUBMED<|>PubMed was used to conduct an extensive literature review on machine learning methodologies in the context of ADE extraction<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>PUBMED<|>PubMed was used to conduct an extensive literature review on deep learning methodologies in the context of ADE extraction<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>BERT is a deep learning model that consistently achieved the best performance in the end-to-end task of ADE extraction<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRADIENT BOOSTING<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>Gradient Boosting is a machine learning model that excelled in the relation classification (RC) task of ADE extraction<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>Multilayer Perceptron is a machine learning model that excelled in the relation classification (RC) task of ADE extraction<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RANDOM FOREST<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>Random Forest is a machine learning model that excelled in the relation classification (RC) task of ADE extraction<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
