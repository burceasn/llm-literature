This comprehensive review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on four pivotal aspects of gynecological health: preterm birth, breast cancer and cervical cancer and infertility treatment. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize gynecology and women’s healthcare. The subsets of AI, namely, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, have aided in detecting complex patterns from huge datasets and using such patterns in making predictions. This paper investigates how machine learning (ML) algorithms are employed in the field of gynecology to tackle crucial issues pertaining to women’s health. This paper also investigates the integration of ultrasound technology with artificial intelligence (AI) during the initial, intermediate, and final stages of pregnancy. Additionally, it delves into the diverse applications of AI throughout each trimester. This review paper provides an overview of machine learning (ML) models, introduces natural language processing (NLP) concepts, including ChatGPT, and discusses the clinical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in gynecology. Additionally, the paper outlines the challenges in utilizing machine learning within the field of gynecology. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING (ML)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that has transformative potential in revolutionizing gynecology and women’s healthcare by detecting complex patterns from large datasets and making predictions)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP LEARNING (DL)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deep learning (DL) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that aids in detecting complex patterns from large datasets and using such patterns for predictions in gynecology)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) tool discussed in the context of clinical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in gynecology)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH GERMANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany is the publisher of the paper under exclusive licence, part of Springer Nature 2024)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature is the parent organization of Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, which holds the exclusive licence for the paper)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GYNECOLOGY<|>EVENT<|>Gynecology is the field of medicine focused on women’s health, particularly reproductive and maternal outcomes, and is being revolutionized by machine learning and AI technologies)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology with applications in gynecology, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), used to address critical women’s health issues)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ULTRASOUND TECHNOLOGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ultrasound technology is integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) during pregnancy stages and has diverse applications throughout each trimester)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING (ML)<|>DEEP LEARNING (DL)<|>Both are subsets of artificial intelligence (AI) used in gynecology to detect patterns and make predictions<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING (ML)<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) used in gynecology<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP LEARNING (DL)<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>Deep learning (DL) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) used in gynecology<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) tool under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI)<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH GERMANY<|>SPRINGER NATURE<|>Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany is part of Springer Nature<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GYNECOLOGY<|>MACHINE LEARNING (ML)<|>Machine learning (ML) is being used to revolutionize gynecology and address critical women’s health issues<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GYNECOLOGY<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>Artificial intelligence (AI) is being integrated into gynecology to improve women’s healthcare<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ULTRASOUND TECHNOLOGY<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>Ultrasound technology is integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) during pregnancy stages<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
