This paper describes the system presented by team UH-MatCom in the challenge. Several deeplearning models are trained and ensembled to automatically extract relevant entities and relations from plain text documents. State of the art techniques such as BERT, Bi-LSTM, and CRF are applied. The use of external knowledge sources such as ConceptNet is explored. The system achieved average results in the challenge, ranking fifth across all different evaluation scenarios. The ensemble method produced a slight improvement in performance. Additional work needs to be done for the relation extraction task to successfully benefit from external knowledge sources. Â© 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
