The PICO framework provides a basis for the retrieval and selection for inclusion of evidence relevant to a specific systematic review question, and automatic approaches to PICO extraction have been developed particularly for reviews of clinical trial findings. Considering the difference between preclinical animal studies and clinical trials, developing separate approaches is necessary. Facilitating preclinical systematic reviews will inform the translation from preclinical to clinical research. Methods: We randomly selected 400 abstracts from the PubMed Central Open Access database which described in vivo animal research and manually annotated these with PICO phrases for Species, Strain, methods of Induction of disease model, Intervention, Comparator and Outcome. We developed a two-stage workflow for preclinical PICO extraction. Firstly we fine-tuned BERT with different pre-trained modules for PICO sentence classification. Then, after removing the text irrelevant to PICO features, we explored LSTM-, CRF- and BERT-based models for PICO entity recognition. We also explored a self-training approach because of the small training corpus. Results: For PICO sentence classification, BERT models using all pre-trained modules achieved an F1 score of over 80%, and models pre-trained on PubMed abstracts achieved the highest F1 of 85%. For PICO entity recognition, fine-tuning BERT pre-trained on PubMed abstracts achieved an overall F1 of 71% and satisfactory F1 for Species (98%), Strain (70%), Intervention (70%) and Outcome (67%). The score of Induction and Comparator is less satisfactory, but F1 of Comparator can be improved to 50% by applying self-training. Conclusions: Our study indicates that of the approaches tested, BERT pre-trained on PubMed abstracts is the best for both PICO sentence classification and PICO entity recognition in the preclinical abstracts. Self-training yields better performance for identifying comparators and strains. © 2022, The Author(s).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural language processing is a field of study that assists in tasks such as extracting PICO elements in systematic reviews to reduce workflow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PICO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The PICO framework is used for the retrieval and selection of evidence relevant to systematic review questions, particularly in clinical trials and preclinical studies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBMED CENTRAL OPEN ACCESS DATABASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A database from which 400 abstracts describing in vivo animal research were randomly selected for manual annotation with PICO phrases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a pre-trained language model used for PICO sentence classification and entity recognition in preclinical studies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LSTM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LSTM is a type of model explored for PICO entity recognition in preclinical studies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CRF is a type of model explored for PICO entity recognition in preclinical studies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SELF-TRAINING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A method explored to improve the performance of PICO entity recognition, particularly for identifying comparators and strains)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>PERSON<|>The author(s) of the study, who concluded that BERT pre-trained on PubMed abstracts is the best approach for PICO sentence classification and entity recognition in preclinical abstracts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<|>PICO<|>Natural language processing assists in extracting PICO elements for systematic reviews<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBMED CENTRAL OPEN ACCESS DATABASE<|>PICO<|>Abstracts from the PubMed Central Open Access database were annotated with PICO phrases<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>PICO<|>BERT was fine-tuned for PICO sentence classification and entity recognition<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LSTM<|>PICO<|>LSTM was explored for PICO entity recognition<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRF<|>PICO<|>CRF was explored for PICO entity recognition<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SELF-TRAINING<|>PICO<|>Self-training was used to improve PICO entity recognition, particularly for comparators and strains<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>PUBMED CENTRAL OPEN ACCESS DATABASE<|>BERT models pre-trained on PubMed abstracts achieved the highest F1 score for PICO sentence classification<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR(S)<|>BERT<|>The author(s) concluded that BERT pre-trained on PubMed abstracts is the best approach for PICO tasks<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
