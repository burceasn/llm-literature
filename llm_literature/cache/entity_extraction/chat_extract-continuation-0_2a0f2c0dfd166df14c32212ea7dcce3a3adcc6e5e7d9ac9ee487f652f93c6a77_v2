Recently, however, more advanced embedding methods and representations (eg, ELMo, BERT) have further pushed the state of the art in NLP, yet there are no common best practices for how to integrate these representations into clinical tasks. The purpose of this study, then, is to explore the space of possible options in utilizing these new models for clinical concept extraction, including comparing these to traditional word embedding methods (word2vec, GloVe, fastText). Materials and Methods: Both off-the-shelf, open-domain embeddings and pretrained clinical embeddings from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) are evaluated. We explore a battery of embedding methods consisting of traditional word embeddings and contextual embeddings and compare these on 4 concept extraction corpora: I2b2 2010, i2b2 2012, SemEval 2014, and SemEval 2015. We also analyze the impact of the pretraining time of a large language model like ELMo or BERT on the extraction performance. Last, we present an intuitive way to understand the semantic information encoded by contextual embeddings. Results: Contextual embeddings pretrained on a large clinical corpus achieves new state-of-the-art performances across all concept extraction tasks. The best-performing model outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with respective F1-measures of 90.25, 93.18 (partial), 80.74, and 81.65. Conclusions: We demonstrate the potential of contextual embeddings through the state-of-the-art performance these methods achieve on clinical concept extraction. Additionally, we demonstrate that contextual embeddings encode valuable semantic information not accounted for in traditional word representations. © 2019 The Author(s).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEURAL NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neural networks are computational models used in natural language processing tasks, including clinical NLP tasks such as concept extraction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELMO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ELMo is an advanced embedding method and representation used in natural language processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is an advanced embedding method and representation used in natural language processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORD2VEC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Word2vec is a traditional word embedding method used in natural language processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GloVe is a traditional word embedding method used in natural language processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FASTTEXT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>fastText is a traditional word embedding method used in natural language processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIMIC-III<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MIMIC-III is a database of medical information used for pretraining clinical embeddings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>I2B2 2010<|>EVENT<|>I2b2 2010 is a concept extraction corpus used in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>I2B2 2012<|>EVENT<|>I2b2 2012 is a concept extraction corpus used in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEMEVAL 2014<|>EVENT<|>SemEval 2014 is a concept extraction corpus used in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEMEVAL 2015<|>EVENT<|>SemEval 2015 is a concept extraction corpus used in the study)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURAL NETWORK<|>ELMO<|>ELMo is an advanced embedding method based on neural networks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURAL NETWORK<|>BERT<|>BERT is an advanced embedding method based on neural networks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELMO<|>BERT<|>Both ELMo and BERT are advanced embedding methods used in natural language processing<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORD2VEC<|>GLOVE<|>Both Word2vec and GloVe are traditional word embedding methods used in natural language processing<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORD2VEC<|>FASTTEXT<|>Both Word2vec and fastText are traditional word embedding methods used in natural language processing<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOVE<|>FASTTEXT<|>Both GloVe and fastText are traditional word embedding methods used in natural language processing<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIMIC-III<|>ELMO<|>MIMIC-III is used for pretraining clinical embeddings, including ELMo<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIMIC-III<|>BERT<|>MIMIC-III is used for pretraining clinical embeddings, including BERT<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I2B2 2010<|>I2B2 2012<|>Both I2b2 2010 and I2b2 2012 are concept extraction corpora used in the study<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEMEVAL 2014<|>SEMEVAL 2015<|>Both SemEval 2014 and SemEval 2015 are concept extraction corpora used in the study<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
