AI technologies and specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) have emerged as tools to study mental health interventions (MHI) at the level of their constituent conversations. However, NLP’s potential to address clinical and research challenges remains unclear. We therefore conducted a pre-registered systematic review of NLP-MHI studies using PRISMA guidelines (osf.io/s52jh) to evaluate their models, clinical applications, and to identify biases and gaps. Candidate studies (n = 19,756), including peer-reviewed AI conference manuscripts, were collected up to January 2023 through PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ArXiv. A total of 102 articles were included to investigate their computational characteristics (NLP algorithms, audio features, machine learning pipelines, outcome metrics), clinical characteristics (clinical ground truths, study samples, clinical focus), and limitations. Results indicate a rapid growth of NLP MHI studies since 2019, characterized by increased sample sizes and use of large language models. Digital health platforms were the largest providers of MHI data. Ground truth for supervised learning models was based on clinician ratings (n = 31), patient self-report (n = 29) and annotations by raters (n = 26). Text-based features contributed more to model accuracy than audio markers. Patients’ clinical presentation (n = 34), response to intervention (n = 11), intervention monitoring (n = 20), providers’ characteristics (n = 12), relational dynamics (n = 14), and data preparation (n = 4) were commonly investigated clinical categories. Limitations of reviewed studies included lack of linguistic diversity, limited reproducibility, and population bias. A research framework is developed and validated (NLPxMHI) to assist computational and clinical researchers in addressing the remaining gaps in applying NLP to MHI, with the goal of improving clinical utility, data access, and fairness. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a technology used to study mental health interventions through analyzing conversations and improving clinical utility, data access, and fairness)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRISMA GUIDELINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PRISMA guidelines are a systematic review framework used to evaluate NLP-MHI studies, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in research)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE LIMITED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature Limited is the publisher of the research article discussing the application of NLP in mental health interventions)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NLPXMHI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NLPxMHI is a research framework developed to address gaps in applying NLP to mental health interventions, aiming to improve clinical utility and fairness)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGITAL HEALTH PLATFORMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Digital health platforms are the largest providers of data for mental health intervention studies using NLP)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEMATIC REVIEW<|>EVENT<|>A systematic review was conducted to evaluate NLP-MHI studies, identifying biases, gaps, and clinical applications)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>DIGITAL HEALTH PLATFORMS<|>Digital health platforms provide data for NLP studies on mental health interventions<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>PRISMA GUIDELINES<|>PRISMA guidelines were used to conduct a systematic review of NLP-MHI studies<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>NLPXMHI<|>NLPxMHI is a framework developed to address gaps in applying NLP to mental health interventions<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEMATIC REVIEW<|>PRISMA GUIDELINES<|>The systematic review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines to ensure transparency and reproducibility<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEMATIC REVIEW<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>The systematic review evaluated the application of NLP in mental health interventions<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE LIMITED<|>SYSTEMATIC REVIEW<|>Springer Nature Limited published the research article discussing the systematic review of NLP-MHI studies<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
