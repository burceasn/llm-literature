These health records are currently coded manually or semi-automated to assign clinical codes (ICD-codes) for clinical research and analytics. This process is very time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. This paper presents a method for automated clinical coding of electronic health records (EHRs) given the patient diagnosis summary and other medical-related documents. The presented method uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which capture knowledge from the free-text diagnosis descriptions, do the text matching and semantic mapping, and translate diagnosis descriptions into clinical codes. We develop one baseline Word2vec and cosine similarity hybrid model, a transformer encoder model, and a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for the automated clinical coding. The presented models are evaluated using a publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset. The used dataset consists of various patient diagnosis descriptions and corresponding ICD-9 codes. The experimental results show that the presented BlueBERT based automated clinical coding model produced an AUC (area under ROC curve) value of 98.9% for the top-10 ICD codes prediction. On the full MIMIC-III dataset, the transformer model produced an accuracy of 76.8%, a precision of 61.02%, a recall of 47.22%, a f1-score of 53.2%, and an AUC value of 92.1%. The hybrid baseline model and another used transformer encoder model also showed promising results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital versions of patients' medical records that contain valuable information for clinical research and analytics, including diagnosis summaries, lab reports, and other medical-related documents)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDICAL INFORMATION MART FOR INTENSIVE CARE III (MIMIC-III)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MIMIC-III is a publicly available dataset consisting of various patient diagnosis descriptions and corresponding ICD-9 codes, used for evaluating automated clinical coding models)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUEBERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BlueBERT is a model used for automated clinical coding, achieving an AUC value of 98.9% for top-10 ICD codes prediction)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature Switzerland AG is the publisher of the paper under exclusive license)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORD2VEC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Word2vec is a baseline model used in the hybrid approach for automated clinical coding)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSFORMER ENCODER MODEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A transformer encoder model is one of the models developed for automated clinical coding, achieving an accuracy of 76.8% on the MIMIC-III dataset)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT (BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a model used for automated clinical coding, leveraging natural language processing techniques)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICD-9 CODES<|>EVENT<|>ICD-9 codes are clinical codes assigned to patient diagnosis descriptions for clinical research and analytics)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOMATED CLINICAL CODING<|>EVENT<|>Automated clinical coding is the process of translating diagnosis descriptions into clinical codes using NLP techniques and models like BlueBERT, Word2vec, and transformer encoder models)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS)<|>MEDICAL INFORMATION MART FOR INTENSIVE CARE III (MIMIC-III)<|>MIMIC-III dataset contains electronic health records used for evaluating automated clinical coding models<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLUEBERT<|>MEDICAL INFORMATION MART FOR INTENSIVE CARE III (MIMIC-III)<|>BlueBERT model was evaluated using the MIMIC-III dataset<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSFORMER ENCODER MODEL<|>MEDICAL INFORMATION MART FOR INTENSIVE CARE III (MIMIC-III)<|>The transformer encoder model was evaluated using the MIMIC-III dataset<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORD2VEC<|>MEDICAL INFORMATION MART FOR INTENSIVE CARE III (MIMIC-III)<|>Word2vec was used in a hybrid model evaluated on the MIMIC-III dataset<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT (BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS)<|>BLUEBERT<|>BlueBERT is a variant of the BERT model used for automated clinical coding<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOMATED CLINICAL CODING<|>ICD-9 CODES<|>Automated clinical coding translates diagnosis descriptions into ICD-9 codes<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG<|>AUTOMATED CLINICAL CODING<|>Springer Nature Switzerland AG published the paper on automated clinical coding<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
