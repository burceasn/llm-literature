The presence of vague terms, ambiguous statements, or conflicting information can lead to misinterpretation and potential harm to patients. Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for understanding the confidence level associated with clinical findings and recommendations. This study focuses on developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to quantify uncertainty in medical reports. Our approach involves the extraction of linguistic cues and patterns indicative of uncertainty, followed by a systematic classification and quantification process. By leveraging machine learning algorithms trained on lexicon proximity-based annotated medical texts, we aim to detect uncertain clinical reports. Additionally, we added an ensemble block to refine the dataset further to eradicate the false positive ratio within the dataset and feed the refined dataset to a BERT model which reduced performance error by 30% correspondingly ensuring a high prediction confidence score which is a very significant improvement in terms of medical application systems.  © 2024 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) FRAMEWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A framework developed to quantify uncertainty in medical reports by extracting linguistic cues and patterns indicative of uncertainty, followed by classification and quantification processes)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT MODEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A machine learning model used to refine datasets and reduce performance error by 30%, ensuring high prediction confidence scores in medical applications)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization that published the study on quantifying uncertainty in medical reports)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) FRAMEWORK<|>BERT MODEL<|>The NLP framework leverages the BERT model to refine datasets and improve prediction confidence scores<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) FRAMEWORK<|>IEEE<|>The NLP framework is part of a study published by IEEE<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT MODEL<|>IEEE<|>The BERT model is referenced in a study published by IEEE<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
