CNNs achieved performance gains in medical image analysis (MIA) over the last years. CNNs can efficiently model local pixel interactions and be trained on small-scale MI data. Despite their important advances, typical CNN have relatively limited capabilities in modelling 'global' pixel interactions, which restricts their generalisation ability to understand out-of-distribution data with different 'global' information. The recent progress of Artificial Intelligence gave rise to Transformers, which can learn global relationships from data. However, full Transformer models need to be trained on large-scale data and involve tremendous computational complexity. Attention and Transformer compartments ('Transf/Attention') which can well maintain properties for modelling global relationships, have been proposed as lighter alternatives of full Transformers. Recently, there is an increasing trend to co-pollinate complementary local-global properties from CNN and Transf/Attention architectures, which led to a new era of hybrid models. The past years have witnessed substantial growth in hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models across diverse MIA problems. In this systematic review, we survey existing hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models, review and unravel key architectural designs, analyse breakthroughs, and evaluate current and future opportunities as well as challenges. We also introduced an analysis framework on generalisation opportunities of scientific and clinical impact, based on which new data-driven domain generalisation and adaptation methods can be stimulated.  © 2013 IEEE.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CNNS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are a type of neural network used in medical image analysis, known for their ability to model local pixel interactions efficiently)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSFORMERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Transformers are a type of artificial intelligence model that can learn global relationships from data, often requiring large-scale data and computational resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSF/ATTENTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Transf/Attention compartments are lighter alternatives to full Transformers, maintaining properties for modeling global relationships)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYBRID CNN-TRANSF/ATTENTION MODELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models combine the complementary local-global properties of CNNs and Transf/Attention architectures, leading to advancements in medical image analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IEEE is the organization that published the systematic review on hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models in medical image analysis)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CNNS<|>TRANSFORMERS<|>CNNs and Transformers are both used in medical image analysis, with CNNs focusing on local pixel interactions and Transformers on global relationships<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSF/ATTENTION<|>TRANSFORMERS<|>Transf/Attention compartments are lighter alternatives to full Transformers, maintaining their global relationship modeling capabilities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYBRID CNN-TRANSF/ATTENTION MODELS<|>CNNS<|>Hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models incorporate the local pixel interaction capabilities of CNNs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYBRID CNN-TRANSF/ATTENTION MODELS<|>TRANSF/ATTENTION<|>Hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models incorporate the global relationship modeling capabilities of Transf/Attention compartments<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IEEE<|>HYBRID CNN-TRANSF/ATTENTION MODELS<|>IEEE published a systematic review on hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models, analyzing their architectural designs and impact<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
