Their applications in vascular surgery have scarcely been investigated to date. This international survey aimed to evaluate the perceptions and feedback from vascular surgeons on the use of AI chatbots in vascular surgery. Methods: This international open e-survey comprised 50 items that covered participant characteristics, their perceptions on the use of AI chatbots in vascular surgery, and their user experience. The study was designed in accordance with the Checklist for reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys and was critically reviewed and approved by international members of the European Vascular Research Collaborative (EVRC) prior to distribution. Participation was open to self reported health professionals specialised (or specialising) in vascular surgery, including residents or fellows. Results: Of the 342 individuals who visited the survey page, 318 (93%) agreed to participate; 262 (82.4%) finished the survey and were included in the analysis. Most were consultants or attending physicians (64.1%), most declared not having any training or education related to AI in healthcare (221; 84.4%), and 198 (75.6%) rated their knowledge about the abilities of AI chatbots between average to very poor. Interestingly, 95 participants (36.3%) found that AI chatbots were very useful or somewhat useful in clinical practice at this stage and 229 (87.4%) agreed that they should be systematically validated prior to being used. Eighty participants (30.5%) had specifically tested it for questions related to clinical practice and 59 (73.8%) of them experienced issues or limitations. Conclusion: This international survey provides an overview of perceptions of AI chatbots by vascular surgeons and highlights the need to improve knowledge and training of health professionals to better evaluate, define, and implement their use in vascular surgery. © 2024 The Author(s)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN VASCULAR RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Vascular Research Collaborative (EVRC) is an international organization that critically reviewed and approved the design of the survey on AI chatbots in vascular surgery)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>VASCULAR SURGEONS<|>PERSON<|>Vascular surgeons are health professionals specializing in vascular surgery who participated in the international survey on AI chatbots)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AI CHATBOTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI chatbots are artificial intelligence-based tools that were evaluated for their potential applications in vascular surgery through an international survey)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL SURVEY<|>EVENT<|>An international survey conducted to evaluate the perceptions and feedback from vascular surgeons on the use of AI chatbots in vascular surgery)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN VASCULAR RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE<|>INTERNATIONAL SURVEY<|>The European Vascular Research Collaborative reviewed and approved the design of the international survey<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>VASCULAR SURGEONS<|>INTERNATIONAL SURVEY<|>Vascular surgeons participated in the international survey to provide feedback on AI chatbots<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>AI CHATBOTS<|>INTERNATIONAL SURVEY<|>The international survey aimed to evaluate the perceptions and applications of AI chatbots in vascular surgery<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>VASCULAR SURGEONS<|>AI CHATBOTS<|>Vascular surgeons provided feedback on the usefulness and limitations of AI chatbots in clinical practice<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
