Methods: A radiologist with 20 years’ experience selected 21 anonymized breast radiology reports, 7 mammography, 7 breast ultrasound, and 7 breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), categorized according to breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS). These reports underwent simplification by prompting ChatGPT-4o with “Explain this medical report to a patient using simple language”. Five breast radiologists assessed the quality of these simplified reports for factual accuracy, completeness, and potential harm with a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). Another breast radiologist evaluated the text comprehension of five non-healthcare personnel readers using a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s α, and the Kruskal–Wallis test were used. Results: Mammography, ultrasound, and MRI showed high factual accuracy (median 2) and completeness (median 2) across radiologists, with low potential harm scores (median 5); no significant group differences (p ≥ 0.780), and high internal consistency (α > 0.80) were observed. Non-healthcare readers showed high comprehension (median 2 for mammography and MRI and 1 for ultrasound); no significant group differences across modalities (p = 0.368), and high internal consistency (α > 0.85) were observed. BI-RADS 0, 1, and 2 reports were accurately explained, while BI-RADS 3–6 reports were challenging. Conclusion: The model demonstrated reliability and clarity, offering promise for patients with diverse backgrounds. LLMs like ChatGPT-4o could simplify breast radiology reports, aid in communication, and enhance patient care. Relevance statement: Simplified breast radiology reports generated by ChatGPT-4o show potential in enhancing communication with patients, improving comprehension across varying educational backgrounds, and contributing to patient-centered care in radiology practice. Key Points: AI simplifies complex breast imaging reports, enhancing patient understanding. Simplified reports from AI maintain accuracy, improving patient comprehension significantly. Implementing AI reports enhances patient engagement and communication in breast imaging.
