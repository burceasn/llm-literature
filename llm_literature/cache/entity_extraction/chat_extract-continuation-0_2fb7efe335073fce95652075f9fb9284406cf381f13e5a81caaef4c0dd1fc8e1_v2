Traditional data analysis methods are often limited by their reliance on structured data, overlooking the wealth of valuable insights embedded within unstructured clinical narratives. Leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLM) and natural language processing (NLP), this study proposes a novel approach to detect OUD by analyzing unstructured data within EHRs. Specifically, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based NLP method is developed and applied to clinical progress notes extracted from the EHR system of Emanate Health System. The study created a data analytics platform utilizing user-centered design for improving clinical decisions. This study contributes to the ongoing effort to combat the opioid crisis by bridging the gap between technology-driven analytics and clinical practice, ultimately striving for improved patient wellbeing and equitable healthcare delivery. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EMANATE HEALTH SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Emanate Health System is a healthcare organization whose EHR system was used in the study to extract clinical progress notes for analyzing opioid use disorder (OUD))  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCITEPRESS – SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PUBLICATIONS, LDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SCITEPRESS is the publisher of the study, which focuses on leveraging AI and NLP to address public health issues like OUD and SDoH)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPIOID USE DISORDER (OUD)<|>EVENT<|>Opioid Use Disorder is a public health issue being addressed through the study's novel approach using AI and NLP to analyze unstructured data in EHRs)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH)<|>EVENT<|>Social Determinants of Health are factors influencing health outcomes, which the study aims to address through advanced data analytics)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is an AI-based NLP method developed and applied in the study to analyze unstructured clinical narratives in EHRs)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLM)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large Language Models are AI tools leveraged in the study to improve the analysis of unstructured data in healthcare)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural Language Processing is a technology used in the study to extract insights from unstructured clinical narratives in EHRs)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMANATE HEALTH SYSTEM<|>OPIOID USE DISORDER (OUD)<|>Emanate Health System's EHR data was used to analyze and detect OUD<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMANATE HEALTH SYSTEM<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT)<|>Emanate Health System's clinical progress notes were analyzed using a BERT-based NLP method<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT)<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>BERT is an NLP-based method used in the study to analyze unstructured data<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLM)<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>LLMs are a type of NLP technology used in the study to improve data analysis<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPIOID USE DISORDER (OUD)<|>SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH)<|>Both OUD and SDoH are public health issues addressed in the study through advanced data analytics<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCITEPRESS – SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PUBLICATIONS, LDA<|>EMANATE HEALTH SYSTEM<|>SCITEPRESS published the study that utilized data from Emanate Health System<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
