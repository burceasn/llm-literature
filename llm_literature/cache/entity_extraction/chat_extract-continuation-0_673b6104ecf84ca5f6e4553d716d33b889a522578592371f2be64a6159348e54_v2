Artificial intelligence virtual assistants (AIVA) and large language models (LLMs) like Google BARD and ChatGPT-4 offer avenues for addressing patient queries using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, the accuracy and appropriateness of the information vary across these platforms, necessitating a comparative study to evaluate their efficacy in this domain. We conducted a study comparing AIVA (using Google Dialogflow) with ChatGPT-4 and Google BARD, assessing the accuracy, knowledge gap, and response appropriateness. AIVA demonstrated superior performance, with significantly higher accuracy (mean: 0.9) and lower knowledge gap (mean: 0.1) compared to BARD and ChatGPT-4. Additionally, AIVA’s responses received higher Likert scores for appropriateness. Our findings suggest that specialized AI tools like AIVA are more effective in delivering precise and contextually relevant information for postoperative care compared to general-purpose LLMs. While ChatGPT-4 shows promise, its performance varies, particularly in verbal interactions. This underscores the importance of tailored AI solutions in healthcare, where accuracy and clarity are paramount. Our study highlights the necessity for further research and the development of customized AI solutions to address specific medical contexts and improve patient outcomes. © 2024 by the authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AIVA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Artificial Intelligence Virtual Assistant (AIVA) is a specialized AI tool using Google Dialogflow, designed to provide accurate and contextually relevant information for postoperative care, demonstrating superior performance in accuracy and appropriateness compared to general-purpose LLMs.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE BARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google BARD is a large language model (LLM) that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to address patient queries, though it shows lower accuracy and higher knowledge gaps compared to specialized AI tools like AIVA.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT-4<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT-4 is a general-purpose large language model (LLM) that shows promise in addressing patient queries but exhibits variability in performance, particularly in verbal interactions, and is less effective than specialized AI tools like AIVA.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE DIALOGFLOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Dialogflow is the platform used by AIVA to deliver precise and contextually relevant information for postoperative care, contributing to its superior performance in accuracy and appropriateness.)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POSTOPERATIVE CARE<|>EVENT<|>Postoperative care is a critical phase in healthcare where patient education and follow-up are pivotal for enhancing the quality of care and satisfaction, and where specialized AI tools like AIVA are being evaluated for their efficacy.)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AIVA<|>GOOGLE DIALOGFLOW<|>AIVA uses Google Dialogflow as its platform to deliver precise and contextually relevant information for postoperative care<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AIVA<|>POSTOPERATIVE CARE<|>AIVA is a specialized AI tool designed to improve the quality of postoperative care by providing accurate and contextually relevant information<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE BARD<|>POSTOPERATIVE CARE<|>Google BARD is evaluated for its efficacy in addressing patient queries in postoperative care but shows lower accuracy compared to specialized AI tools like AIVA<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT-4<|>POSTOPERATIVE CARE<|>ChatGPT-4 is evaluated for its efficacy in addressing patient queries in postoperative care but exhibits variability in performance compared to specialized AI tools like AIVA<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AIVA<|>GOOGLE BARD<|>AIVA demonstrates superior performance in accuracy and appropriateness compared to Google BARD in addressing patient queries for postoperative care<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AIVA<|>CHATGPT-4<|>AIVA demonstrates superior performance in accuracy and appropriateness compared to ChatGPT-4 in addressing patient queries for postoperative care<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
