Methods: A synthetic database is created with 20,000 clinical notes of patients where there are mentions to musculoskeletal pathologies. A classifier based on Latxa-7b is developed. This classifier is later trained with clinical notes and finally its performance in detecting malignant bone tumors is analyzed. Results: A classifier is created whose performance in the training and test data sets is 97.7% precision, 98.6% accuracy, 94.2% sensitivity, 0.99 area under curve and 0.96 F1. Conclusions: The excellent performance of the classifier described in this work should serve as a spur to start applying Natural Language Processing to the digitized medical records we use in our healthcare systems. © 2024 Academia de Ciencias Médicas de Bilbao.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
