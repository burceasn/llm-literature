While previous studies have explored the capabilities of specific LLMs like ChatGPT in cardiac imaging, a comprehensive evaluation comparing multiple LLMs in the context of CAD-RADS 2.0 has been lacking. This study addresses this gap by assessing the performance of various LLMs, including ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 4o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Mistral Large, Meta Llama 3 70B, and Perplexity Pro, in answering 30 multiple-choice questions derived from the CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT 4o achieved the highest accuracy at 100 %, with ChatGPT 4 and Claude 3 Opus closely following at 96.6 %. Other models, including Mistral Large, Perplexity Pro, Meta Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, also demonstrated commendable performance, though with slightly lower accuracy ranging from 90 % to 93.3 %. This study underscores the proficiency of current LLMs in understanding and applying CAD-RADS 2.0, suggesting their potential to significantly enhance radiological reporting and patient care in coronary artery disease. The variations in model performance highlight the need for further research, particularly in evaluating the visual diagnostic capabilities of LLMs—a critical component of radiology practice. This study provides a foundational comparison of LLMs in CAD-RADS 2.0 and sets the stage for future investigations into their broader applications in radiology, emphasizing the importance of integrating both text-based and visual knowledge for optimal clinical outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large language models (LLMs) are advanced natural language processing systems that have shown transformative potential in various fields, including radiology and coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT 4<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT 4 is a large language model that achieved 96.6% accuracy in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT 4O<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT 4o is a large language model that achieved 100% accuracy in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLAUDE 3 OPUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Claude 3 Opus is a large language model that achieved 96.6% accuracy in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEMINI 1.5 PRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gemini 1.5 Pro is a large language model that achieved 90% to 93.3% accuracy in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISTRAL LARGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mistral Large is a large language model that achieved 90% to 93.3% accuracy in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>META LLAMA 3 70B<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Meta Llama 3 70B is a large language model that achieved 90% to 93.3% accuracy in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERPLEXITY PRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Perplexity Pro is a large language model that achieved 90% to 93.3% accuracy in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAD-RADS 2.0<|>EVENT<|>CAD-RADS 2.0 is a set of guidelines used for the diagnosis and reporting of coronary artery disease (CAD))  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD)<|>EVENT<|>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a medical condition that the study aims to diagnose more accurately using large language models)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RADIOLOGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Radiology is the medical field that benefits from the application of large language models in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT 4<|>CAD-RADS 2.0<|>ChatGPT 4 was evaluated for its performance in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT 4O<|>CAD-RADS 2.0<|>ChatGPT 4o achieved the highest accuracy in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLAUDE 3 OPUS<|>CAD-RADS 2.0<|>Claude 3 Opus was evaluated for its performance in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEMINI 1.5 PRO<|>CAD-RADS 2.0<|>Gemini 1.5 Pro was evaluated for its performance in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MISTRAL LARGE<|>CAD-RADS 2.0<|>Mistral Large was evaluated for its performance in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>META LLAMA 3 70B<|>CAD-RADS 2.0<|>Meta Llama 3 70B was evaluated for its performance in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERPLEXITY PRO<|>CAD-RADS 2.0<|>Perplexity Pro was evaluated for its performance in answering questions derived from CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>RADIOLOGY<|>Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance accuracy and efficiency in radiology, particularly in diagnosing coronary artery disease<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD)<|>RADIOLOGY<|>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition that radiology aims to diagnose more accurately using large language models<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
