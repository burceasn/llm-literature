This paper surveys the cutting-edge achievements in applying PLMs to various medical NLP tasks. Specifically, we first brief PLMS and outline the research of PLMs in medicine. Next, we categorise and discuss the types of tasks in medical NLP, covering text summarisation, question-answering, machine translation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, information extraction, medical education, relation extraction, and text mining. For each type of task, we first provide an overview of the basic concepts, the main methodologies, the advantages of applying PLMs, the basic steps of applying PLMs application, the datasets for training and testing, and the metrics for task evaluation. Subsequently, a summary of recent important research findings is presented, analysing their motivations, strengths vs weaknesses, similarities vs differences, and discussing potential limitations. Also, we assess the quality and influence of the research reviewed in this paper by comparing the citation count of the papers reviewed and the reputation and impact of the conferences and journals where they are published. Through these indicators, we further identify the most concerned research topics currently. Finally, we look forward to future research directions, including enhancing models’ reliability, explainability, and fairness, to promote the application of PLMs in clinical practice. In addition, this survey also collect some download links of some model codes and the relevant datasets, which are valuable references for researchers applying NLP techniques in medicine and medical professionals seeking to enhance their expertise and healthcare service through AI technology. © 2024 The Authors\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a pre-trained language model used in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including medical NLP tasks)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOBERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BioBERT is a pre-trained language model specifically designed for biomedical text mining and NLP tasks)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a pre-trained language model developed by OpenAI, used in various NLP tasks, including medical applications)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>EVENT<|>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of study focused on enabling machines to understand and process human language, with applications in medicine and other domains)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRE-TRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS (PLM)<|>EVENT<|>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are advanced models like BERT, BioBERT, and ChatGPT that are pre-trained on large datasets and fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDICAL NLP TASKS<|>EVENT<|>Medical NLP tasks include text summarization, question-answering, machine translation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, information extraction, and relation extraction, among others)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>BERT is a pre-trained language model used in NLP tasks<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOBERT<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>BioBERT is a pre-trained language model specifically designed for biomedical NLP tasks<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>ChatGPT is a pre-trained language model used in NLP tasks<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRE-TRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS (PLM)<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>PLMs are a key component of NLP, enabling advanced language understanding and processing<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEDICAL NLP TASKS<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>Medical NLP tasks are a subset of NLP tasks focused on applications in medicine<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>PRE-TRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS (PLM)<|>BERT is a type of pre-trained language model<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOBERT<|>PRE-TRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS (PLM)<|>BioBERT is a type of pre-trained language model<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>PRE-TRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS (PLM)<|>ChatGPT is a type of pre-trained language model<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>MEDICAL NLP TASKS<|>BERT is applied to various medical NLP tasks<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOBERT<|>MEDICAL NLP TASKS<|>BioBERT is specifically designed for medical NLP tasks<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>MEDICAL NLP TASKS<|>ChatGPT is applied to various medical NLP tasks<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
