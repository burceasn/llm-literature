With the proliferation of medical literature and the development of deep learning, the automatic extraction of biological entity interaction relationships from literature has shown great potential. The fundamental scope of this research is that the approach described in this research uses technologies like dynamic word vectors and multichannel convolution to learn a larger variety of relational expression semantics, allowing it to detect more entity connections. The extraction of biological entity relationships is the foundation for achieving intelligent medical care, which may increase the effectiveness of intelligent medical question answering and enhance the development of precision healthcare. In the past, deep learning methods have achieved specific results, but there are the following problems: the model uses static word vectors, which cannot distinguish polysemy; the weight of words is not considered, and the extraction effect of long sentences is poor; the integration of various models can improve the sample imbalance problem, the model is more complex. The purpose of this work is to create a global approach for eliminating different physical entity links, such that the model can effectively extract the interpretation of the expression relationship without having to develop characteristics manually. To this end, a deep multichannel CNN model (MC-CNN) based on the residual structure is proposed, generating dynamic word vectors through BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) to improve the accuracy of lexical semantic representation and uses multihead attention to capture the dependencies of long sentences and by designing the Ranking loss function to replace the multimodel ensemble to reduce the impact of sample imbalance. Tested on multiple datasets, the results show that the proposed method has good performance.  © 2022 Ajay Kumar Singh et al.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHERS<|>PERSON<|>Biomedical researchers are individuals who search literature to find relationships between biological entities such as drug-drug and compound-protein interactions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOLOGISTS<|>PERSON<|>Biologists are individuals who study biological entities and their interactions, often using literature to find relationships)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>EVENT<|>Deep learning is a technology used to automatically extract biological entity interaction relationships from literature, showing great potential in medical research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MC-CNN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MC-CNN is a deep multichannel CNN model based on the residual structure, proposed to improve the accuracy of lexical semantic representation and capture dependencies in long sentences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) is a technology used to generate dynamic word vectors, improving the accuracy of lexical semantic representation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AJAY KUMAR SINGH<|>PERSON<|>Ajay Kumar Singh is one of the authors of the research paper discussing the extraction of biological entity relationships using deep learning methods)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHERS<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>Biomedical researchers use deep learning to extract biological entity interaction relationships from literature<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOLOGISTS<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>Biologists use deep learning to study and extract relationships between biological entities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MC-CNN<|>BERT<|>MC-CNN uses BERT to generate dynamic word vectors, improving the accuracy of lexical semantic representation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AJAY KUMAR SINGH<|>MC-CNN<|>Ajay Kumar Singh is one of the researchers who proposed the MC-CNN model<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AJAY KUMAR SINGH<|>BERT<|>Ajay Kumar Singh is one of the researchers who utilized BERT in the proposed MC-CNN model<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
