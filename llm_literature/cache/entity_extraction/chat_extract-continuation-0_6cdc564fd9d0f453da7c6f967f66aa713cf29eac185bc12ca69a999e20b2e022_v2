Traditional symptom checkers often lack accuracy and efficiency in diagnosing diseases, as they typically rely on preprogrammed decision trees or rule-based algorithms that may not account for the complexity and variability of symptoms. By using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, such as knowledge graphs and Bio-Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BioBERT), chatbots can provide a more accurate and personalized approach to disease diagnosis. This paper introduces a hybrid chatbot framework called “BGKnow.” BGKnow represents the combination of a knowledge graph and Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) model that uses BioBERT embeddings for effective diagnosis based on symptoms entered by users. The proposed system shows promising potential for assisting healthcare professionals in accurately and efficiently addressing medical inquiries. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BGKNOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BGKnow is a hybrid chatbot framework that combines a knowledge graph and GPT-2 model using BioBERT embeddings for accurate disease diagnosis based on user symptoms)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER NATURE SINGAPORE PTE LTD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd is the publisher of the paper under exclusive license)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>EVENT<|>NLP is a technique used in the development of BGKnow to improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>EVENT<|>Machine learning techniques, such as knowledge graphs and BioBERT, are used in the BGKnow framework to enhance diagnostic capabilities)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KNOWLEDGE GRAPH<|>EVENT<|>A knowledge graph is a component of the BGKnow framework that helps in understanding the relationships between symptoms and diseases)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIO-BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BIOBERT)<|>EVENT<|>BioBERT is a machine learning model used in the BGKnow framework for effective disease diagnosis)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMER 2 (GPT-2)<|>EVENT<|>GPT-2 is a model integrated into the BGKnow framework to enhance its diagnostic capabilities)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BGKNOW<|>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)<|>BGKnow uses NLP techniques to improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BGKNOW<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>BGKnow incorporates machine learning techniques, such as knowledge graphs and BioBERT, for effective diagnosis<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BGKNOW<|>KNOWLEDGE GRAPH<|>BGKnow integrates a knowledge graph to understand the relationships between symptoms and diseases<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BGKNOW<|>BIO-BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BIOBERT)<|>BGKnow uses BioBERT embeddings to enhance its diagnostic capabilities<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BGKNOW<|>GENERATIVE PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMER 2 (GPT-2)<|>BGKnow combines GPT-2 with a knowledge graph for effective diagnosis<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BGKNOW<|>SPRINGER NATURE SINGAPORE PTE LTD<|>Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd published the paper introducing BGKnow<|>5)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
