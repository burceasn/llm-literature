While conspiracy theories present complex narratives attributing significant events to covert actions by powerful and malicious entities, critical thinking involves scrutinizing decisions without resorting to any sinister explanations. Making this distinction is essential to avoid the mislabeling of valid criticism as conspiracy, which may unintentionally lead people to join conspiracy communities. Conspiratorial and critical narratives are both examples of oppositional thinking, which is important in public debate, particularly in controversial areas like public health. In this direction, “Oppositional thinking analysis: Conspiracy theories vs critical thinking narratives\"- a shared task organized at PAN 2024, invites the research community to address the challenges of distinguishing between conspiracy and critical texts in English and Spanish languages. To explore the strategies for distinguishing between critical and conspiracy texts in English and Spanish on social media platforms, in this paper, we - team MUCS, describe the models proposed for Subtask-1: \"Distinguishing between critical and conspiracy texts\" of the shared task. We explored machine learning models trained with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) of char n-grams in the range (1, 5) and transfer learning techniques using several BERT variants fine-tuned with the given English and Spanish datasets, to classify the given unlabeled English and Spanish text into one of the two categories -'CONSPIRACY' or'CRITICAL'. Among the proposed models, English_BERT and Spanish_BERT models obtained Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) scores of 0.7162 and 0.6293 for English and Spanish languages respectively. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
