Recent studies in AI-based mental healthcare have paid attention to the benefits and ethical considerations of this experience. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of the literature on the ethical application of AI in mental healthcare. The results indicate that multiple studies observed a positive effect of AI-based mental healthcare through machine learning (ML), chatbots and AI-based MH-apps. However, these benefits are gradually diminishing due to the need for more ethical considerations. Based on an extensive analysis of the data from a range of AI technologies, such as computer vision, natural language processing and ML, it was discovered that AI-driven technologies had shown promising outcomes in the diagnosis of several mental disorders, including schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. © ISTE Ltd 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
