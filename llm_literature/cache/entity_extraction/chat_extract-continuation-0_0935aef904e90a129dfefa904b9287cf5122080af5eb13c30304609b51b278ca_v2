However, its widespread use has raised ethical and security concerns. This study examines the presence of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, in the literature of plastic surgery. Methods: A bibliometric analysis and scoping review of the ChatGPT plastic surgery literature were performed. PubMed was queried using the search term “ChatGPT” to identify all biomedical literature on ChatGPT, with only studies related to plastic, reconstructive, or aesthetic surgery topics being considered eligible for inclusion. Results: The analysis included 30 out of 724 articles retrieved from PubMed, focusing on publications from December 2022 to July 2023. Four key areas of research emerged: applications in research/creation of original work, clinical application, surgical education, and ethics/commentary on previous studies. The versatility of ChatGPT in research, its potential in surgical education, and its role in enhancing patient education were explored. Ethical concerns regarding patient privacy, plagiarism, and the accuracy of information obtained from ChatGPT-generated sources were also highlighted. Conclusion: While ethical concerns persist, the study underscores the potential of ChatGPT in plastic surgery research and practice, emphasizing the need for careful utilization and collaboration to optimize its benefits while minimizing risks.
