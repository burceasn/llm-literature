Large language models (LLMs) are an emerging technology with promising capabilities for the automation of language-related tasks that may be useful for such a purpose. Methods: LLMs were used as part of an automated system to evaluate the relevance of publications to a certain topic based on defined criteria and based on the title and abstract of each publication. A Python script was created to generate structured prompts consisting of text strings for instruction, title, abstract, and relevant criteria to be provided to an LLM. The relevance of a publication was evaluated by the LLM on a Likert scale (low relevance to high relevance). By specifying a threshold, different classifiers for inclusion/exclusion of publications could then be defined. The approach was used with four different openly available LLMs on ten published data sets of biomedical literature reviews and on a newly human-created data set for a hypothetical new systematic literature review. Results: The performance of the classifiers varied depending on the LLM being used and on the data set analyzed. Regarding sensitivity/specificity, the classifiers yielded 94.48%/31.78% for the FlanT5 model, 97.58%/19.12% for the OpenHermes-NeuralChat model, 81.93%/75.19% for the Mixtral model and 97.58%/38.34% for the Platypus 2 model on the ten published data sets. The same classifiers yielded 100% sensitivity at a specificity of 12.58%, 4.54%, 62.47%, and 24.74% on the newly created data set. Changing the standard settings of the approach (minor adaption of instruction prompt and/or changing the range of the Likert scale from 1–5 to 1–10) had a considerable impact on the performance. Conclusions: LLMs can be used to evaluate the relevance of scientific publications to a certain review topic and classifiers based on such an approach show some promising results. To date, little is known about how well such systems would perform if used prospectively when conducting systematic literature reviews and what further implications this might have. However, it is likely that in the future researchers will increasingly use LLMs for evaluating and classifying scientific publications. © The Author(s) 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Emerging technology used for automating language-related tasks, including evaluating the relevance of scientific publications for systematic reviews)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLANT5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specific large language model used in the study, achieving 94.48% sensitivity and 31.78% specificity in classifying publications)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENHERMES-NEURALCHAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specific large language model used in the study, achieving 97.58% sensitivity and 19.12% specificity in classifying publications)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIXTRAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specific large language model used in the study, achieving 81.93% sensitivity and 75.19% specificity in classifying publications)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLATYPUS 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A specific large language model used in the study, achieving 97.58% sensitivity and 38.34% specificity in classifying publications)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON SCRIPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool created to generate structured prompts for large language models to evaluate the relevance of scientific publications)  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW<|>EVENT<|>A process of systematically screening published literature to synthesize relevant publications, which the study aims to automate using large language models)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW<|>Large language models are used to automate the evaluation of publications for systematic literature reviews<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLANT5<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>FlanT5 is one of the large language models used in the study<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENHERMES-NEURALCHAT<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>OpenHermes-NeuralChat is one of the large language models used in the study<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIXTRAL<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>Mixtral is one of the large language models used in the study<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLATYPUS 2<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>Platypus 2 is one of the large language models used in the study<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTHON SCRIPT<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>The Python script generates structured prompts for large language models to evaluate publications<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
