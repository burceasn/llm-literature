It tokenizes DNA sequences using the K-mer method, where overlapping k-mers serve as tokens, enabling the model to capture intricate patterns within biological sequence data. Trained on the human genome, DNABERT has demonstrated improved performance in sequence classification tasks, making it a valuable tool for biological sequence data analysis. By leveraging its ability to process and interpret DNA sequences, DNABERT bridges the gap between natural language processing techniques and genomics, offering enhanced capabilities for understanding and classifying genetic information.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092144, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 306, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 118}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
