NLP algorithms are applied to EHR data to generate unsupervised representations of disease sequences, enabling the identification of patterns and trends in patient health data. Additionally, NLP is used to extract and screen data from EHRs, facilitating the retrieval of relevant information for clinical decision-making and research. NLP tools are specifically designed to analyze and extract information from unstructured text within EHRs, such as physician notes, discharge summaries, and other free-text entries. This capability enhances the usability of EHR data by transforming unstructured information into structured, actionable insights, ultimately improving patient care and advancing medical research. Together, NLP and EHR systems form a powerful combination that leverages advanced computational techniques to unlock the potential of healthcare data.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092210, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 371, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 73}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
