BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a foundational model in the field of transfer learning for NLP tasks. RoBERTa, a variant of BERT, was developed to improve upon the original model by optimizing its training process and architecture. In the context of the study, both models were employed to analyze digital narratives for mental health diagnostics and to extract SBDoH concepts, with RoBERTa eventually replacing BERT as the preferred neural language model in the proposed method. Despite their differences, both BERT and RoBERTa share the common goal of advancing NLP capabilities through transfer learning and have been instrumental in advancing research in sentiment analysis and healthcare-related text analysis.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092208, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 162}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
