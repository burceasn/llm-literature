In the context of Kannada code-mixed language, these models are part of an ensemble approach employed for sentiment analysis, achieving a weighted F1-score of 0.66, indicating their effectiveness in handling complex linguistic scenarios. Additionally, specific transformer-based models, such as Multilingual-BERT and XLM-R, have been investigated for emotion analysis tasks. Among these, XLM-R demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest macro F1-score, which underscores its robustness and adaptability in emotion classification tasks. Overall, transformer-based models, including Multilingual-BERT and XLM-R, have proven to be highly effective in both sentiment and emotion analysis, particularly in multilingual and code-mixed language contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092175, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 371, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 71}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
