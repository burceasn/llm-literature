In one instance, a systematic review was conducted to compare the performance of ChatGPT and human researchers in extracting key information from clinical articles, highlighting the capabilities and limitations of both approaches. Another systematic review focused on examining the processes and challenges associated with Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in healthcare, utilizing established methodologies such as PRISMA and PICO to ensure rigor and transparency. \n\nAdditionally, a systematic review was carried out to analyze methods for extracting Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) from clinical notes, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of identifying such events in medical records. Another review evaluated studies on Natural Language Processing for Mental Health Informatics (NLP-MHI), identifying biases, gaps, and potential clinical applications of these technologies. Lastly, a systematic review surveyed existing hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Transformer/Attention models, reviewing key architectural designs and analyzing breakthroughs in medical image analysis, which contributes to advancements in diagnostic and analytical tools in healthcare. \n\nCollectively, these systematic reviews demonstrate the versatility and importance of this research method in addressing diverse challenges and opportunities in healthcare, from information extraction and model evaluation to the application of advanced technologies in clinical settings.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092152, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 529, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 194}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
