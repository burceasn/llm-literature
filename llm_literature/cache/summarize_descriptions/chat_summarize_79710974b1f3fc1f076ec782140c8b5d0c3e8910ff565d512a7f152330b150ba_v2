It has become a valuable resource for researchers and analysts due to its extensive user-generated content. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter played a significant role in identifying public sentiments, analyzing reactions to vaccines, and monitoring hate speech, particularly against Asians, with studies downloading millions of tweets for these purposes. The platform has also been utilized for COVID-19 surveillance and prediction through machine learning methods, as well as for analyzing global health-related topics, such as Lyme disease, through tweet data. Additionally, Twitter has been a source of data for sentiment analysis on diverse subjects, including healthcare-related tweets, eating disorders, and user feedback on products and services. Its datasets have been used to represent specific populations, such as Canadians, and to conduct sentiment and topic analysis on a broad scale.
