It serves as the foundation for numerous applications, including powering conversational AI systems like the AI-guide bot, and is employed in research studies to extract and analyze information from medical texts, such as patient discharge summaries, focusing on tobacco, alcohol, and substance use. GPT-3.5 has also been evaluated for its performance in medical contexts, including its ability to answer questions related to rhinological pathologies and its performance on the Spanish MIR medical examination. Additionally, it has been assessed for its accuracy and completeness in retrieving dermatology knowledge and has demonstrated high performance on the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). However, its evaluation for non-English speaking nations' medical licensing exams remains limited. In cognitive performance evaluations, GPT-3.5 has shown significant disparities in memory and speech assessments when compared to physician-led evaluations and its successor, GPT-4. Despite these limitations, GPT-3.5 continues to be a versatile and widely used model in NLP research and applications, particularly in zero-shot learning tasks and medical knowledge retrieval.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092136, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 239, "prompt_tokens": 361, "total_tokens": 600, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 297}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
