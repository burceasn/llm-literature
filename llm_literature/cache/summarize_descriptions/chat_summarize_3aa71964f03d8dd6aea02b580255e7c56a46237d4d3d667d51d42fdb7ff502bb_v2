It has been employed in multiple scoping and systematic reviews to identify relevant publications on diverse topics, including artificial intelligence (AI) applications in dermatology, natural language processing (NLP) applications in vascular surgery, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction research, and the use of ChatGPT and large language models (LLMs) in academic medicine and heart failure (HF) care. Specifically, MEDLINE was searched in April 2023 for studies on NLP applications in vascular surgery, highlighting its role as a key resource for accessing up-to-date and credible scientific literature. Its consistent use across these varied research areas underscores its reliability and importance as a digital database for biomedical and medical research.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092139, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 244, "total_tokens": 401, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 180}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
