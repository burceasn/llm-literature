These models represent a significant milestone in the evolution of language modeling, profoundly impacting the field of artificial intelligence and enabling advancements across various domains. LLMs are widely discussed and applied in fields such as healthcare and academia, where they are utilized to filter through vast volumes of publications, such as those on PubMed, to identify clinically important articles. This capability is increasingly leveraged by researchers, including those at HiRU, to streamline information retrieval and analysis. Additionally, LLMs serve as the underlying technology powering chatbots like ChatGPT, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to user prompts.
