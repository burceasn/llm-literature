This process involves a variety of tasks, including named entity recognition, relation extraction, and knowledge graph construction, all of which are essential for organizing and interpreting complex biomedical data. Recent progress in the field has been driven by the application of deep learning methods, which have significantly improved capabilities in areas such as few-shot learning and interpretability. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, biomedical text mining enables researchers and practitioners to uncover insights that can inform medical research, clinical decision-making, and the development of new treatments. Overall, it represents a critical intersection of computational methods and biomedical science, aimed at enhancing the understanding and utilization of vast amounts of textual data in the healthcare domain.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092153, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 158}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
