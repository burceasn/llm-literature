It is one of the primary sources from which adverse drug events (ADEs) are extracted, aiding in the identification and understanding of potential risks associated with medications. Additionally, biomedical literature is extensively utilized by clinical and research doctors to stay informed about recent advancements in their field of study. It supports the generation and validation of new theories, guides the design and execution of experiments, and facilitates the analysis of results. Overall, biomedical literature plays a pivotal role in advancing medical knowledge, improving patient care, and ensuring the safety and efficacy of treatments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092185, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 318, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 124}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
