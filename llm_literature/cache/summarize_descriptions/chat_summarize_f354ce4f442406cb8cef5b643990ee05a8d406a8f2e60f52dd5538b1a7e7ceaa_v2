It serves as a keyword mining method to extract main candidate themes from interview transcripts in qualitative research, helping researchers identify significant terms and patterns within textual data. Additionally, TF-IDF is employed as a text representation technique in projects such as the Arabic health care assistant, where it aids in text classification tasks by quantifying the importance of words in documents relative to a corpus. This dual application highlights its utility in both qualitative research and practical text-based systems, making it a valuable tool across diverse domains.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092164, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 162, "total_tokens": 284, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 98}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
