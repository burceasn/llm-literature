They authored a paper discussing ethical considerations for NLP (Natural Language Processing) AI models, which was published under an exclusive licence to the Indian Association of Surgical Oncology. Additionally, they provided a perspective on AI and psychedelic medicine, published in the *Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences*. Their work also includes a research article evaluating ChatGPT's impact and applications, published under the exclusive licence of the Biomedical Engineering Society. \n\nThe AUTHOR(S) conducted a study specifically evaluating ChatGPT-3.5's role in medical writing, highlighting both its benefits and limitations. They have also contributed to research on clinical concept extraction using advanced embedding methods. Furthermore, they developed a study protocol and CHART reporting guideline, which is published under a CC BY-NC license. In 2024, they published research on the application of BERT models in medical image protocol assignment. \n\nAdditionally, the AUTHOR(S) are responsible for research and publications on automating the assessment of online health information quality.
