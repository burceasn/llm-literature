It is designed to maintain high performance while being more lightweight and computationally efficient compared to its predecessor. DISTILBERT has been applied in various studies and tasks, including the identification of potential Lyme disease cases from self-reported tweets, where it demonstrated improved performance when enriched with emoji data. Additionally, it has been utilized in research to extract COVID-related relations, showcasing its versatility in handling diverse NLP applications.
