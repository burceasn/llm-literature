BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a prominent model within NLP, based on the Transformer architecture. It is widely recognized as a deep learning model specifically designed for NLP tasks, demonstrating significant effectiveness in various applications, including healthcare. BERT is utilized for processing textual data, leveraging its bidirectional context understanding to achieve state-of-the-art results in language-related studies. While some descriptions refer to BERT as a \"technique\" within NLP, it is more accurately characterized as a model or framework that employs advanced techniques to enhance language understanding.
