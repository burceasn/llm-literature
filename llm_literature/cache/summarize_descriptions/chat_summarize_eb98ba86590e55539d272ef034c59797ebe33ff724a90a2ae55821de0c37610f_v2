It is primarily focused on the monitoring and study of drug safety, with a particular emphasis on identifying and reporting adverse effects. This field plays a vital role in ensuring the safe use of medications and is increasingly leveraging advanced technologies, such as ChatGPT, to enhance the detection and reporting of adverse drug reactions. Additionally, pharmacovigilance is a key area of interest in Adverse Drug Event (ADE) extraction research, which aims to improve the understanding and management of drug-related risks. The integration of pharmacovigilance principles has also been proposed as a model for managing risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI), highlighting its broader applicability beyond traditional drug safety. Overall, pharmacovigilance serves as a foundational framework for safeguarding public health through rigorous safety monitoring and risk management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092167, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 384, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 144}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
