It serves as the foundation for various applications, including large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Foresight, which excel in text generation and question-answering. One notable implementation of this architecture is the **Clinical Longformer**, a model specifically designed to process longer documents, making it suitable for tasks such as named entity recognition in clinical or medical contexts. Additionally, transformer-based models have been proposed in research to automate the assessment of thought disorder severity in schizophrenia patients. This application leverages both textual and acoustic speech data, demonstrating the model's adaptability to multimodal inputs and its potential in clinical and diagnostic settings. Overall, transformer-based models represent a powerful and flexible AI architecture with broad applicability across diverse domains, from general NLP tasks to specialized clinical applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092180, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 397, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 155}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
