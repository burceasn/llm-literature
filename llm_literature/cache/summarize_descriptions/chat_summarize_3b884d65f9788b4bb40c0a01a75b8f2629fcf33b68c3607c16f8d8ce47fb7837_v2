These trials face significant challenges, particularly in patient matching and planning, which can hinder their efficiency and effectiveness. To address these challenges, advancements in technology, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), are being explored as potential solutions to streamline processes like patient recruitment and trial design. Additionally, tools like C2Q 3.0 aim to automate the extraction of eligibility criteria, further enhancing the precision and speed of trial setup. Furthermore, clinical trials stand to benefit from improved outcome measures, particularly in conditions like ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), where AI tools are being developed to evaluate emotional responses and other nuanced metrics. These innovations collectively aim to optimize clinical trials, making them more efficient, inclusive, and capable of delivering meaningful results.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092169, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 139}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
