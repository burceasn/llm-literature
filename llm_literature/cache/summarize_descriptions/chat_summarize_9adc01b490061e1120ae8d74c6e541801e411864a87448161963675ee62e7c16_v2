These models are utilized in various applications within healthcare and biomedical domains. LLMs are employed to generate accurate insights, summaries, and potential diagnoses from structured patient data, improving decision-making processes. Additionally, they are used in software tools to extract chemical entities from biomedical text documents, facilitating case-based learning methodologies. LLMs also play a crucial role in analyzing unstructured data in healthcare, enabling more comprehensive and efficient data interpretation. Furthermore, they are leveraged to address challenges in extracting Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) information from clinical text, utilizing state-of-the-art models like BERT and RoBERTa. Overall, LLMs serve as powerful tools for enhancing data analysis, text extraction, and decision support in both clinical and scientific contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092155, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 268, "total_tokens": 443, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 204}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
