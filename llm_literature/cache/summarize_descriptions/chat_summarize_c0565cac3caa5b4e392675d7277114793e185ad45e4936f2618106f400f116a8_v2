In one study, GPT-3.5 demonstrated improved recall and F1-score for identifying substance use status, albeit at the expense of precision, highlighting the trade-offs inherent in few-shot learning approaches. This method has also been applied to predict rare disease areas, where the scarcity of data poses significant challenges. Additionally, few-shot learning has been investigated in the context of biomedical natural language processing (NLP) tasks, with a focus on understanding the impact of interpretability on model performance. Furthermore, it has been proposed as a method to enhance the detection of mental health disorders through the use of carefully engineered prompts, showcasing its versatility and potential in addressing complex, data-constrained problems across diverse domains.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092147, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 163}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
