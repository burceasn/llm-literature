It was utilized in a system presented by UH-MatCom, demonstrating its effectiveness in advanced applications. Specifically, CRF has been applied to detect tumor morphology mentions in Spanish clinical texts, showcasing its capability in processing and analyzing complex medical language. Additionally, CRF has been investigated as a model for PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) entity recognition in preclinical studies, highlighting its versatility in extracting structured information from scientific and medical data. Overall, CRF is a robust and adaptable technique with significant applications in natural language processing and biomedical text analysis.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092178, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 323, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 121}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
