Both models were employed in a study to extract COVID-related relations, showcasing their applicability in analyzing and understanding complex datasets related to the pandemic. Additionally, they are used in the field of mental health diagnostics, demonstrating their versatility across different domains. DistilBERT, specifically, is a distilled version of BERT, designed to be more efficient while retaining much of the original model's performance.
