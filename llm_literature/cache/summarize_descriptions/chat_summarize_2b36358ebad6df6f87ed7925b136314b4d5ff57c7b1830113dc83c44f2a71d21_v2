By tailoring medical treatments and interventions to the unique genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors of each patient, PM has the potential to significantly improve health outcomes. However, it also carries risks, such as exacerbating health inequalities and potentially diverting resources from basic healthcare needs, which must be carefully managed. \n\nThe field of Precision Medicine requires specific competencies, as highlighted in various reviews, with a strong emphasis on patient involvement and bioethics to ensure ethical and equitable implementation. Additionally, PM, particularly its genomics component, represents a critical information need in biomedical research. This need is increasingly being addressed by AI-based literature search tools, which help researchers navigate the vast and complex body of scientific knowledge to advance the field. Overall, Precision Medicine stands at the intersection of cutting-edge technology, personalized care, and ethical considerations, offering both opportunities and challenges for the future of healthcare.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092171, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 447, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 171}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
