It involves the development of automated systems that can process both formal and colloquial texts, facilitating interactions between computers and human language. NLP has been significantly advanced by large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, BERT, and Transformer-based architectures, which are integral to systems like ChatGPT. These models enable tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and the generation of human-like text, making NLP a cornerstone of AI-driven applications.\n\nNLP has diverse applications across various sectors, including healthcare, education, and customer service. In healthcare, it is used for medical text classification, patient sentiment analysis, clinical decision support, and the extraction of relevant information from medical records to generate health reports. It also underpins mHealth interventions, enhancing user knowledge on activity-related topics, and is applied in radiology workflows for optimizing reports and text data-mining. Additionally, NLP is utilized in analyzing customer reviews to extract insights into satisfaction and preferences, as well as in vaccine-related sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter.\n\nProminent examples of NLP applications include AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard, which use NLP to create humanlike, conversational dialogues with clinicians, patients, and users. NLP is also discussed in academic contexts, such as the book \"Transformative AI,\" and is a key area of research in transformer-based question-answering systems for health-related contexts.
