In the context of clinical natural language processing (NLP), MTL is employed to combine various clinical named entity recognition (NER) datasets, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize across different domains. Additionally, MTL is a key approach in adverse drug event (ADE) extraction research, where it enables the joint learning of multiple tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). By leveraging shared representations and optimizing for multiple objectives, multi-task learning facilitates more robust and efficient models in both clinical and ADE-related applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092187, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 318, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 116}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
