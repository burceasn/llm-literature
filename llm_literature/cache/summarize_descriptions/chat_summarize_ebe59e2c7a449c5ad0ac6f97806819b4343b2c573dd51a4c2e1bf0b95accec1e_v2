It is a transformer-based model, similar to BERT, and has been utilized for tasks such as detecting early signs of mental health concerns and negation detection in biomedical texts. Additionally, XLNet has been adapted for use in bioinformatics, where it has been trained on protein sequence data to analyze and model biological sequences. This broad range of applications highlights XLNet's flexibility and effectiveness across both natural language processing and specialized scientific domains.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092161, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 300, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 128}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
