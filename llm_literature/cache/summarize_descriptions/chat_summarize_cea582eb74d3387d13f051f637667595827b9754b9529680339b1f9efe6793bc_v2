It serves as a key resource for systematically searching and indexing original articles, peer-reviewed studies, and other relevant publications across various fields. SCOPUS is frequently employed in systematic reviews, bibliometric analyses, and research studies to identify and collect relevant literature. For instance, it has been used to search for studies on topics such as ChatGPT and AI research, natural language processing in mental health interventions (NLP-MHI), adverse drug event (ADE) extraction, and case reports of foreign body injuries in children. Additionally, SCOPUS has been specifically referenced as a medical database for investigating the use of ChatGPT in heart failure (HF) care. Its broad scope and systematic indexing make it a valuable tool for researchers conducting literature reviews, meta-analyses, and other academic inquiries across diverse disciplines.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092159, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 302, "total_tokens": 480, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 238}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
