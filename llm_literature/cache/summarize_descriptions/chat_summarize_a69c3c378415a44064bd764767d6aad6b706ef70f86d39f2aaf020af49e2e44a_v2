It challenged healthcare systems by necessitating the rapid accumulation of biological and medical knowledge about the disease, its treatment, and containment. The pandemic also significantly increased patient engagement in patient portals, reflecting a shift toward digital health solutions. \n\nIn addition to its physical health implications, the COVID-19 pandemic escalated mental health issues globally, contributing to social isolation, economic instability, and a rise in suicidal behavior. This surge in mental health challenges led to a 95% increase in the use of mental health forums, websites, and applications, as individuals sought support and resources online. \n\nThe pandemic also influenced the thematic focus of academic and professional publications, such as those in JMIR, with a heightened emphasis on digital health and advanced technologies. Furthermore, it accelerated the adoption of virtual medicine and conversational chatbots for medical purposes, underscoring the critical role of technology in addressing healthcare needs during the crisis. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a transformative event, reshaping healthcare delivery, mental health support, and the integration of digital tools in medicine.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092158, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 245, "prompt_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 558, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 249}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
