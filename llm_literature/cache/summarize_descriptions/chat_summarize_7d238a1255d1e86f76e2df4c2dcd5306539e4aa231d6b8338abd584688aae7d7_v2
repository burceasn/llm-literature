It leverages natural language processing (NLP) to capture subtle patterns of language use in context, making it highly effective for a variety of tasks, including text generation, refinement, and the identification of fake news. In academic medicine, LLMs like GPT-4 are utilized for tasks such as text generation and refinement, though their application necessitates human oversight and transparency to ensure accuracy and ethical use.
