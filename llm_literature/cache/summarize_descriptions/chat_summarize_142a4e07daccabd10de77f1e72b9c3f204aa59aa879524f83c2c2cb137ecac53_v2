These systems contain both structured data, such as medication and diagnosis details, and unstructured data, including clinical notes, diagnosis summaries, lab reports, and other medical-related documents. EHRs serve as a critical resource for clinical research and analytics, providing valuable insights into patient care and medical outcomes. They are leveraged by advanced technologies, including natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning models, to extract and analyze information, such as social determinants of health (SDOH) and clinical tasks. For instance, studies have utilized models like BERT to analyze EHR data, demonstrating their utility in evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare. Additionally, EHRs are integrated with preventive guidelines to improve healthcare outcomes and are used to identify specific medical conditions, such as chronic cough cases. Overall, EHRs play a pivotal role in supporting healthcare providers in decision-making, enhancing clinical research, and advancing the application of artificial intelligence in the medical field.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1737092165, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 430, "total_tokens": 647, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 366}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
