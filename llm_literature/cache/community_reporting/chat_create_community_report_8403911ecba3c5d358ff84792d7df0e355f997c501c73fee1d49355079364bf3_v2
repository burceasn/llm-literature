It plays a critical role in various specialized domains, including clinical and biomedical text analysis. In the clinical domain, NER is used to extract named entities from clinical notes, such as medications, dosages, adverse drug events (ADEs), and other relevant information. For instance, it is applied in the breast cancer domain for Spanish texts to identify and classify entities specific to that context. Additionally, NER is a key component in Adverse Drug Event (ADE) extraction research, where it identifies entities like drugs and their associated adverse effects in clinical notes. A specialized subfield of NER, known as BioNER, focuses on biomedical texts, further highlighting the versatility and importance of NER in both general and domain-specific applications.
