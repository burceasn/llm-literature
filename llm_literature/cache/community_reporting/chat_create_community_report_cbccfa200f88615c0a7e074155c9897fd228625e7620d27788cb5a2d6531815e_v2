As a family of pre-trained language models, BERT is widely used for various NLP tasks, including text classification, segmentation, feature encoding, and contextual representation. It has set a new standard for capturing contextual information in text, making it highly effective for both general and domain-specific applications.\n\nBERT has been applied in diverse research areas, demonstrating its versatility and state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it has been used to build predictive models for detecting hate speech against Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic, achieving an F1 score of 0.85. In the clinical domain, BERT has been employed to analyze unstructured clinical narratives in electronic health records (EHRs), classify social determinants of health (SDoH) concepts such as homelessness and food insecurity, and detect tumor morphology mentions in Spanish clinical texts. Additionally, BERT has been integrated with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to fine-tune input and output layers for text analysis tasks, further enhancing its capabilities.\n\nThe model has also shown exceptional accuracy in specific applications, such as filtering non-medical documents in EHR systems with 98% accuracy and predicting mental health cases with 87.6% accuracy. As a pretrained text embedding technique, BERT is utilized for document clustering, classification, and improving linguistic feature representation in models like E-CLS. Its ability to understand the context of words in a sentence has made it a cornerstone in NLP, influencing the broader field of artificial intelligence and enabling advancements in both research and
