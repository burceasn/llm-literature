As a family of pre-trained language models, BERT is widely used for various NLP tasks, including text classification, segmentation, feature encoding, and contextual representation. It has set a new standard for capturing contextual information in text, making it highly effective for both general and domain-specific applications.\n\nBERT has been applied in diverse research areas, demonstrating its versatility and state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it has been used to build predictive models for detecting hate speech against Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic, achieving an F1 score of 0.85. In the clinical domain, BERT has been employed to analyze unstructured clinical narratives in electronic health records (EHRs), classify social determinants of health (SDoH) concepts such as homelessness and food insecurity, and detect tumor morphology mentions in Spanish clinical texts. Additionally, BERT has been integrated with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to fine-tune input and output layers for text analysis tasks, further enhancing its capabilities.\n\nThe model has also shown exceptional accuracy in specific applications, such as filtering non-medical documents in EHR systems with 98% accuracy and predicting mental health cases with 87.6% accuracy. As a pretrained text embedding technique, BERT is utilized for document clustering, classification, and improving linguistic feature representation in models like E-CLS. Its ability to understand the context of words in a sentence has made it a cornerstone in NLP, influencing the broader field of artificial intelligence and enabling advancements in both research and practical applications.\",24\r\n1025,FEATURE ENCODING,A technique used in the study for processing image data,1\r\n1154,LONG-TERM SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM),A deep learning model used in the study to build predictive models of hate speech against Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic.,1\r\n1155,BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM,A deep learning model used in the study to build predictive models of hate speech against Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic.,1\r\n1156,BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM WITH DROPOUT,A deep learning model used in the study to build predictive models of hate speech against Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic.,1\r\n1157,CONVOLUTION,A deep learning model used in the study to build predictive models of hate speech against Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic.,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n469,BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT),CONTEXTUAL EMOTIONAL TRANSFORMER-BASED MODELS (CETM),CETM incorporates BERT for enhanced mental health case prediction,28\r\n1437,BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT),FEATURE ENCODING,BERT is used for feature encoding in the study,25\r\n1648,LONG-TERM SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM),BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT),LSTM and BERT are both deep learning models used in the study to predict hate speech against Asians.,25\r\n1649,BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM,BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT),Bidirectional LSTM and BERT are both deep learning models used in the study to predict hate speech against Asians.,25\r\n1650,BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM WITH DROPOUT,BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT),Bidirectional LSTM with Dropout and BERT are both deep learning models used in the study to predict hate speech against Asians.,25\r\n1651,CONVOLUTION,BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT),Convolution and BERT are both deep learning models used in the study to predict hate speech against Asians.,25\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
