It is a transformer-based language model that uses bidirectional encoder representations to generate contextualized word embeddings, enabling it to capture the context and semantics of words effectively. BERT has been extensively applied across various domains, including healthcare, sentiment analysis, and information extraction, achieving state-of-the-art results in numerous tasks.\n\nIn healthcare, BERT has been utilized for a wide range of applications, such as analyzing customer reviews, evaluating online health information, and identifying high-quality biomedical literature. It has shown promising results in tasks like adverse drug event (ADE) detection and extraction, achieving high F1 scores (e.g., 92.17 in customer review analysis and 73% for term recognition in medical term recognition). BERT has also been employed for sentiment analysis in healthcare informatics, including classifying patient speech and analyzing vaccine-related tweets, where it achieved high accuracy and AUC values. Additionally, it has been used for extracting Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) information from electronic health records (EHRs) and improving named entity recognition in clinical texts.\n\nBERT's versatility extends to other NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis on Twitter data, causality mining, and text summarization. It has been used in frameworks like the Asanas Recommendation Engine (ARE) for data encoding and in the FedFSA framework for functional status impairment classification. BERT has also been applied in medical image protocol classification, demonstrating near-human performance in identifying relevant words for protocol assignment. Furthermore, it has been used for negation detection in biomedical texts and for extracting COVID-related relations from clinical narratives.\n\nIn addition to its applications in healthcare, BERT has been employed in general NLP tasks, such as fake news detection, semantic similarity measurement, and multi-label classification of tweets expressing concerns about COVID-19 vaccines. It has also been used as a benchmark for other models, such as RxBERT and LLaMA-2, and as a foundation for specialized models like Entity-BERT. Despite its widespread success, BERT has been noted to have vulnerabilities, such as susceptibility to backdoor attacks, and has been replaced by models like RoBERTa in some sentiment and emotion recognition methods.\n\nOverall, BERT is a powerful, pre-trained language model that has revolutionized NLP by providing contextualized word embeddings and achieving state-of-the-art\",149\r\n104,BIGRU,Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) is a neural network layer used in conjunction with transformer models for improved performance in fake news detection,2\r\n1337,PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION,\"Public health communication is the field impacted by the research findings, enabling precise monitoring of public sentiment and vaccine-related concerns\",2\r\n2766,HEALTHCARE INFORMATICS,,2\r\n896,SPACE MEDICINE,\"Space medicine is a field of study involving human, animal, and in-vitro studies, used as datasets for evaluating BERT models\",1\r\n897,SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SCREENING,Systematic review screening is a classification task aiming to select articles fulfilling specific criteria for further review,1\r\n898,BACKTRANSLATION,Backtranslation is a data augmentation technique used to handle class imbalance in datasets,1\r\n1686,KNOWLEDGE GRAPH EMBEDDINGS (KGES),\"Knowledge graph embeddings are used to compute latent representations of entities extracted from social media posts, enabling context-based predictions.\",1\r\n1777,ESTONIAN HEALTHCARE,Estonian healthcare is the domain where the proposed pipeline for information extraction is applied,1\r\n2282,DNA ENHANCER PREDICTION,\"DNA enhancer prediction is a well-known and challenging problem in bioinformatics, where BERT-based features were applied to improve performance\",1\r\n2283,T-SNE,t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a visualization technique used in the study to map the learned embeddings of chief complaints in a clinically meaningful way.,1\r\n2710,ARABICBERT,ArabicBERT is a fine-tuned BERT model evaluated in the study for Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis.,1\r\n2711,ARABERT,AraBERT is a fine-tuned BERT model evaluated in the study for Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis.,1\r\n2712,QARIB,QARiB is a fine-tuned BERT model evaluated in the study for Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis.,1\r\n2713,CAMELBERT,CAMeLBERT is a fine-tuned BERT model evaluated in the study for Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis.,1\r\n2717,MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS,Machine learning classifiers are used in the study alongside BERT models for aspect-based sentiment analysis.,1\r\n2764,PATIENT SPEECH,Patient speech refers to the linguistic data analyzed by the BERT model to assess mental health conditions,1\r\n2765,MENTAL HEALTH TRENDS,Mental health trends are patterns or changes in mental health conditions that the BERT model can predict,1\r\n102,COVID-TWITTER-BERT (CT-BERT),\"COVID-Twitter-BERT (CT-BERT) is a specialized transformer-based model fine-tuned for COVID-19-related text analysis, including fake news detection\",6\r\n1336,COVID-19 VACCINES,Covid-19 vaccines are the subject of public sentiment and concerns analyzed in the research paper,3\r\n2763,KAGGLE MENTAL HEALTH CORPUS,The Kaggle Mental Health Corpus is a dataset used for training and evaluating models in mental health analysis,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n28,BERT,MACHINE LEARNING,\"BERT is a breakthrough method in machine learning, specifically designed as an advanced model for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
