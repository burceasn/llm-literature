It is a transformer-based language model that uses bidirectional encoder representations to generate contextualized word embeddings, enabling it to capture the context and semantics of words effectively. BERT has been extensively applied across various domains, including healthcare, sentiment analysis, and information extraction, achieving state-of-the-art results in numerous tasks.\n\nIn healthcare, BERT has been utilized for a wide range of applications, such as analyzing customer reviews, evaluating online health information, and identifying high-quality biomedical literature. It has shown promising results in tasks like adverse drug event (ADE) detection and extraction, achieving high F1 scores (e.g., 92.17 in customer review analysis and 73% for term recognition in medical term recognition). BERT has also been employed for sentiment analysis in healthcare informatics, including classifying patient speech and analyzing vaccine-related tweets, where it achieved high accuracy and AUC values. Additionally, it has been used for extracting Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) information from electronic health records (EHRs) and improving named entity recognition in clinical texts.\n\nBERT's versatility extends to other NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis on Twitter data, causality mining, and text summarization. It has been used in frameworks like the Asanas Recommendation Engine (ARE) for data encoding and in the FedFSA framework for functional status impairment classification. BERT has also been applied in medical image protocol classification, demonstrating near-human performance in identifying relevant words for protocol assignment. Furthermore, it has been used for negation detection in biomedical texts and for extracting COVID-related relations from clinical narratives.\n\nIn addition to its applications in healthcare, BERT has been employed in general NLP tasks, such as fake news detection, semantic similarity measurement, and multi-label classification of tweets expressing concerns about COVID-19 vaccines. It has also been used as a benchmark for other models, such as RxBERT and LLaMA-2, and as a foundation for specialized models like Entity-BERT. Despite its widespread success, BERT has been noted to have vulnerabilities, such as susceptibility to backdoor attacks, and has been replaced by models like RoBERTa in some sentiment and emotion recognition methods.\n\nOverall, BERT is a powerful, pre-trained language model that has revolutionized NLP by providing contextualized word embeddings and achieving state-of-the-art\",149\r\n1983,ELMO,\"ELMo, short for Embeddings from Language Models, is an advanced embedding method and representation technique widely used in natural language processing (NLP).
