In the context of research, Reddit has been utilized as a valuable source of personal narratives and user-generated content. Specifically, the platform was employed in a study where 273 posts were collected and manually annotated by domain experts to analyze and predict suicidal ideation using AI techniques. Additionally, Reddit was used to compare information with PubMed, enabling researchers to assess the performance of language models in understanding and processing health-related content.
