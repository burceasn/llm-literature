These models have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and are widely applied across various domains, including healthcare, education, finance, and creative industries. In healthcare, LLMs are utilized for tasks such as clinical note summarization, diagnosis, treatment planning, patient communication, and medical research. They have shown significant potential in improving clinical decision-making, automating the extraction of medical criteria from guidelines, and enhancing precision treatment and personalized patient care. Specific applications include identifying pathologic complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients, analyzing behavioral data for depression detection, and generating simplified patient summaries.\n\nLLMs are also employed in multilingual and multidomain tasks, such as fake news detection, machine translation, and question-answering. They have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating coherent and relevant responses, even in complex scenarios like evaluating scientific publications for systematic reviews or addressing patient queries in postoperative care. Notable examples of LLMs include GPT-4, Google BARD, and ChatGPT, which are integrated into various sectors for their fluency, adaptability, and continuous learning capabilities.\n\nDespite their transformative potential, LLMs face challenges, including sensitivity to instruction phrasing, biases in alignment processes, and limitations in contextual awareness and trust-building. Ethical concerns regarding their implementation and usage, particularly in sensitive areas like mental health and clinical decision-making, have also been raised. Additionally, while LLMs excel in general-purpose tasks, they may lack domain-specific comprehension, such as in medical and health concepts, necessitating further refinement and specialization.\n\nOverall, LLMs represent a significant evolution in AI technology, offering opportunities to enhance communication, automate complex tasks, and advance research across multiple fields.
