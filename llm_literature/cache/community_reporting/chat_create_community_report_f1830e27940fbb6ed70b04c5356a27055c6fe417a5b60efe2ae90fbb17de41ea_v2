It encompasses a wide range of applications across various sectors, including healthcare, biotechnology, agriculture, education, finance, and social media. AI leverages advanced techniques such as machine learning (ML), neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Sora to enable intelligent functions such as knowledge acquisition, problem-solving, decision-making, and data analysis.\n\nIn healthcare, AI plays a pivotal role in enhancing diagnostic capabilities, clinical decision-making, and patient care. It is integrated into medical diagnostics, including ophthalmology chatbots, cancer diagnosis systems, and tools for analyzing unstructured data in electronic health records (EHRs). AI-powered systems assist radiologists, improve clinical validation, and mitigate biases in medical diagnostics. It is also used in predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic studies in cancer research, as well as in oral oncology for advancing diagnosis, therapy, and patient care. AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, are being utilized to improve medical writing, laboratory test interpretation, and the analysis of medical literature. Additionally, AI supports mental wellness by analyzing social media data for patterns of suicidal behavior or emotional distress and enhances mental health interventions.\n\nBeyond healthcare, AI is applied in biotechnology, sustainability, and global problem-solving. It is used in agriculture to address challenges in developing nations, in education for surgical training and ethical challenges, and in retailing and social media for operational efficiency and business transformation. However, its rapid adoption raises ethical concerns, including algorithmic bias, data privacy, and job displacement, necessitating responsible deployment and oversight by human experts.\n\nAI is also integrated into digital healthcare systems for anonymizing and processing health information, automating tasks like PPM classification to reduce workload, and enhancing Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis and treatment systems through NLP. Its transformative potential extends to communication strategies, where it disrupts traditional approaches, and to industries like gynecology, where it addresses critical women’s health issues using ML and deep learning (DL).\n\nOverall, AI is a versatile and impactful technology that continues to evolve, offering significant benefits while posing challenges that require careful management to
